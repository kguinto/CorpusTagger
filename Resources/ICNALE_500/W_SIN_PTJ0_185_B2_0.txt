Although finding full-time employment in Singapore may be a relatively difficult task due to the fact that Singaporeans are generally more affluent and educated today than they were before, part-time jobs are still readily available. What really matters is whether people are willing to take up these jobs or not. Part time jobs are usually routine tasks that can be easily and quickly completed. As such, students, housewives or even retired personnel are more than willing to take up part-time work. Not only can they earn an extra source of income through part-time work, they can also occupy the spare time that they have by doing something meaningful, albeit the possibility of having to carry out repetitive tasks. A particularly popular part-time job among students is to work as a salesperson at retail outlets. Retail outlets usually have long operating hours and they will require salespersons to provide service to customers at every point in time. Therefore, they frequently hire part-time sales staff for that purpose. Consequently, most retail outlets offer their part-time staff flexible working hours. This is a definitely a draw to students who are looking for work that will not affect their attendance in school. Moreover, students can definitely make do with the extra cash for the latest model of hand phone that have practically been salivating over for the past months. Ultimately, I think that earning a little extra pocket money through part time work is fine. However, it is imperative to bear in mind that while some time may have been set aside for work, some too has to be set aside for studies. After all, shouldn't studies be the primary concern and responsibility of students?
