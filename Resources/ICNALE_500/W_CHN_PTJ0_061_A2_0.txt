In China more and more college students undertaking a part time job. Even some of them has started their own business. So it is becoming common to see college students selling products in the supermarket or cleaning dishes in the restaurant. However, it is truth that for a college student his most important goal must be to learn well and to get a high score in examinations. So many people oppose university students having a part time work but in my opinion it is important for college students to have a part time job. First university life is consist of lots of parts and do work is one of them. So part time job shouldn't be rejected by us. Second do a job has advantages for college students. They can broaden their social experience. Maybe a student who has a part time job will get better conversation skill. Besides they are also able to save the money which their parents send to them every month or they can use the salary to buy something they like such as changing a new phone. In addition, work helps a student to develop greater independence and team-work spirit. So all of these reasons above, I believe that it is important for college students to have a part time job.
