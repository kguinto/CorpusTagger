I think the part time job is not important for college students It is wasting time to study and they will have low grade in test. Also they doesn't have time to do they are homework And they are going to part time job at night or morning They will be tired or exhausted. Then they slept in the class Or they can't concentrate in class. And they want money for what? They earned money for tuition? Some students are working at night for tuition of college. But other students are working for they are leisure time. They doing part time job, earned money and they spend it For travel the club, buy a jewel or elect, and drinking with them are friends And they not interested in class. They have low attendance rate of class. Reason of this things, I disagree the part time job for college students These things are not much necessary things for college students. And they don't have to do part time job except poor students They must quit the part time job, and they doing best for they are class or homework It is the best way for college students that don't doing part time job.
