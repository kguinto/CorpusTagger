I disagree with this statement. I think part-time job is not so necessary for college students. The first reason is that what is more important for college students is to study. However, most of the students around me don't study very hard. I think part-time job is one of its reasons. Some of my friends work very hard at night and they can't get up early in the next morning to go to school. That is not good. It is nice idea to work moderately when we are free and nothing to do, but overwork is not good for our school life and the health, too. The second reason is that we can have a job anytime in our life, so we don't have to do it when we are college students. I think there are something that we can do only now- to make many friends and play with them, to join club activity or circle activity, to travel abroad and go to many places in the world, and so on. These are difficult to do after we graduate from college and have a job or get married, and once we begin a job, we must work every day and can't do these easily. We should think what we can do and what to do now, and enjoy our school life.
