Nowadays, more and more college students are taking part-time jobs. On this phenomenon, different people have different opinions. As far as I'm concerned, part-time jobs benefit us so much and we can try our best to take a part-time job well. Firstly, students who do a part-time job can earn themselves money which helps to release the financial burden on their parents. Also, that makes students know how difficult does their parents earn money. Secondly, they will have colorful weekends or holidays. They will harvest much more fun from it. Thirdly, they will meet different kinds of people, which makes students more independent and more mature. It's necessary for the college students to learn more about the society so as to keep up with the outside world. Knowing more about the society surely will be good to their future. Of course, students should play the main role to study. Part-time job is just a little part of their life. If a student spends too much time and energy on part-time job, it would effect his study time. As a consequence, taking a part-time job at your free time is a good choice and is important for college students.
