I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are many reasons for me to agree that. First, we cherish money. By having a part-time job, we will know that it is hard to earn money. So we cherish money. Also we will spend money more effectively. I had a part-time job last 3months. I tutored students in academy at that time. It is fun to me. I tutored 2days per week but I have no free time because of too much assignments. So I quitted that part-time job. After I had a part-time job, I cherish money. It is good experience for me. Second, we become independent. If we have a part-time job, we earn money ourselves. So we become independent economically. Also Our parents save money. Because we earn allowance ourselves. Third, part-time job offer social experience. So we can experience society before we are part of social member. However, if we have too many part-time job to disturb studying, part-time job is not good experience anymore. I think having one part-time job is enough in case of tutoring students. In conclusion, it is good for college students to have a part-time job.
