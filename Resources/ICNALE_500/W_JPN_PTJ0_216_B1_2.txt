I think it is very important thing for college students to have a part-time job. At first, if we do that, we can study about our community. After graduating from college, maybe almost all of the students get out into the world. So in advance, to be accustomed to surroundings or human relations, and of course working itself is very useful for us. Second, I also think that to have a part-time job and make money for ourselves contribute to our independence from parents. Third, in fact I often hear that if we work part-time, it is hard for us to make both the classes of college or club activities and the part-time job go together. However, I disagree with that opinion. This is because even if we had less time to do such activities, we can train our ability to use time efficiently by joining plural activities. At last, we can realize how important the money is. Actually I'm working part-time as a teacher of juku school now. And everything I bought with my income is very precious to me. And also I'm planning to go to a trip with my earned money during this summer vacation. I will continue working and enjoy my meaningful school days in *** University.
