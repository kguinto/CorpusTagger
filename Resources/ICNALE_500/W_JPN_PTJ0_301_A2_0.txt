I am for that students do part-time jobs, for they have many chances that they spend money for mainly friends, lovers, parents and so on. As a result, they face shortage of money. Doing part-time jobs has another meaning for them. It is having social experiences gotten by working in social places not in schools or at home. They will help students when they work anywhere after they graduate from their school. Until they have part-time job even if they fail, they may be allowed with smile. But there are something's financial in social places, so they cannot be allowed at all if they fail. Even if they are allowed, next is nothing. Following this, students come to have large responsibility. Furthermore, money gotten by working may tell them "real" way of spending money. Not receiving from parents but earning personally may also tell them "interesting of working".  Finally, by working outside of schools their relationship is more extended and in the place where they do part-time jobs, many things taught by "pre-runner of life" enrich their life in the future. For all, doing part-time jobs will be something's that teach students many, many things that are important when they go through variable things and have their life lively. So I am for this.
