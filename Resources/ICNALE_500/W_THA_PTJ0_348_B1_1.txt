Nowadays, many college students prefer to do part time job for many reasons both positive and negative reasons. For example, they want to help their parents to get money, and they want to buy brand name products or serve their desire. However, I disagree that college students have a part time job for three reasons. First, they should have enough time to do their assignments or reread books that they studied in classes. I think that it is more important than doing part time jobs because it is their main duty. Second, most of part time jobs have to do on late night. So, it is so dangerous when they go back home as you can see criminal news in every day. They should safe their life for the glad future. Third, they might have not enough time to take a rest. They have to study a lot and hard studying in each day. For this reason, they might be tried and sleepy when they are in class. Therefore, college student should give more time for their duty that is studying. Part time jobs might disturb the main duty. It is better if college students do many jobs after they granduate.
