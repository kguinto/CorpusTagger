I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time jog. There are some reasons that I think so. First, I think that we can experience various things through a part-time job that leads our life richer. And we can learn what is society. I think these experiences are useful for my future. These experiences will be useful for business. For example, I think that we will be able to know how to deal with the problem. Second, so college students are almost adult person, we should live a life of independence as we can. When we get a job we must live a life of independence, so I think that we should be used to be the type of life as soon as possible. And if we start to have a part-time job, we make our schedule by ourselves. I think that it is a very important thing to decide our plan. To control my life is a first step to be a nice adult person. Finally we make a new relation to make us better and the relation make our life more attractive. Because I think that to hear many other opinions grow us.
