Today, many students earn special money by the Working Part Time Jobs which do most of the students will work in the service as a waiter or waitress or servers such as in food shop, in the mall, or working with media, Internet café and etc. Most of the students due to work Part Time to earn extra classes and to alleviate the burden of families taking time to make the experience useful and work well. Work Part Time is a very important to students in today's society, particularly the loss of property in the study. The students have to make a right decision when they decide to work. It's true parents want to see us got a good result from the study when we are in university, then want to see us got a high salary when we graduate. This is the steps that we all know that our parents expect to see. But for some family, parents think that they just want to see their children grow up and can stand by their own feet. That's all that they need, so they don't expect that their children must get a good grade or high salary. The children will be pressured so parents don't expect too high. So to have part time job may useful for students who lack of money, useful for students who want to have job record, useful for students who want to have experience and many reasons. No one knows but ourselves know. Please make a good consideration before go to work is what I suggest.
