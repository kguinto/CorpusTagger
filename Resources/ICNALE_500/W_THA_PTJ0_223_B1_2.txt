I think having a part-time job it's great. A part-time job help you increase your responsibility, patient, teach you how the world after graduation will look like, give you more money, more experience of life... etc. But of course everything has pros and cons. I think of finding a part-time job too lately and that's when I start to find more cons about it. First of all I will have to arrange my time for extra hours after study for whatever job I'd get. I will definitely have less time for study in the evening, less time to hang out with my friends, less time to spend with my family, less time for any activities, in any case less time for sleep. But if you plan to do anything in the future that connects with money (in fact in everyday life anything has something to do with money anyway) saving some money from now on wouldn't hurt you or anyone. Because money will always support you when somebody won't and with money you can do what you want or whatever plan you have easier. It is even better when you decide to save some money when you're only a student, a part-time job may not pay as much as you want it to be but it is money.
