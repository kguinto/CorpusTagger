I think working Part Time during school hours Backpacks important to me because of working Part Time Well after learning completion it will be extra income for students to work Part Time off us from the class and to must have a job after school take that any benefits and also the life experience that has it all. Also in the training before we graduated and meet with universal others people. Can contact people outside university areas and expand the contacts. It will easily to get job in the future and will easily to talk and work with people. The most important thing it is to help parents save and reduce money for send to us to spend in school. It is important to impress with our own money with parents they will be very happy to see us grow up and that is a model of conservation when we share ideas to people and savings money more than ever and that it is the best thing in life for the people who work Part Time. Will be good in the next future when we write work experience in CV, they will see the work experience and may get the job easily rather than people who got good grade but have no experience.
