I disagree with the statement. It is not important for college students to have a part-time job; in fact, it is important that they do not have a part time job. The whole purpose of going to college is to study, not to work. Some might argue that working part time will be good experience for the students to prepare for the working world, but would the experience be better gained through internships that are related to what the students are studying rather than working a part-time job that doesn't help the student in future. In fact, internships would make a better portfolio than part-time jobs. Through internships, students get to apply what they learnt, compared to working part-time. Working part-time also decreases the time the student have to study, which undermines that purpose of college. Although part-timing provide the student with an early source of income, it would be better for the student focus more on studying and achieve a good grade so that he or she can secure a good job in today's meritocratic society. Therefore, I would not recommend part-time working to students. But I have no objections against internship. Internships have no repercussions on the student's education in college and help them to learn more, therefore, it is a more viable alternative to part-time working.
