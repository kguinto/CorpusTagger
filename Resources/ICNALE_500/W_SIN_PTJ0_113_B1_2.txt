College students are also known as University Students in the context of Asia. Due to certain societal cultures, these students may live alone or they may still live with their parents. Paying school fees is a huge worry for both college students and their family as a lack of money to afford these hefty fees could hinder advancement in education for the students. To finance this, some students opt to take a bank loan or they may choose to find a part-time job to pay the fees. Depending on the financial situation of the student, the way he copes with this burden is different. Therefore, it is not important for students to have a part-time job. For students who have the ability to afford university education, such as those born with a silver spoon, definitely university fees are not much of a big deal. For example, film director Eric Khoo who was born into one of the richest families in Singapore, probably did not have a problem affording university in the United Kingdom and further education. Also, part-time jobs may be additional stress to students. Students in university level are piled with projects and assignments with tons of deadlines to meet and having part-time jobs eats away time that could have been spent revising and completing their homework. To juggle with the demands, students end up sacrificing sleep. Constant sleep deprivation may affect performance and health of the student. In this viscous cycle, students who fail to cope may end up dropping out of competitive society in university. Therefore, students should only take up part-time jobs if they really cannot afford to pay their school fees and material wants or if they are able to cope with both the demands of working and homework.
