I disagree with "It is important for college students to have a part-time job. " The purpose of going to college is to study, to anticipate in varies university's activities and to make friends. Part-time job would use up most of our time, leaving us an exhausting body and a bad mood, thus causing a lot of problems in school. For example, one won't be able to concentrate in the morning class after a four tiring hours of work late last night; one won't have the time to gather up with friends, or even just discussing homework together. Because of this, students' grades may drop. When the grades drop, parents started to worry, and it might turns out to be another family fight. Although some might claims that having a part-time job is essential for adjusting the society, one can also gain early social experience by doing internships or volunteers, without having the pressures because of the amount of money. When one have more time to study the course in college, and to prepare more for the upcoming challenges and difficulties, it is more likely that one will have a better job after graduation, and a more memorable university's life to be remember. In order to have a better life in college, a better study quality and better grades, I disagree with "It is important for college students to have a part-time job. "
