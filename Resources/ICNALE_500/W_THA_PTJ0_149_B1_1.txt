I do agree because it is important that we can make money by ourselves but everyone does not have to have a part- time job. If we have part-time job we will receive more money and we will not bother family on money. The part-time job is a good way to find new experiences of work we can be stronger on any work we have done. The important thing that we get from the job is we will pound of ourselves and see though money value. However when we get the part-time job we should organize our time for class and lesson and we should to do the job when we have free time enough. When we earn, we can buy anything that we want but part-time job gives us not much money so we have to be careful to use it do not waste money but save money to buy the important things or pays for college. The students who work while studying they will get the skills of doing work, so they can adapt these skills on their occupations and they will get good job. The most important thing that they will realize are what is the difficult way to get money by working? and how difficult to do it? It will be the best way to make them stronger and grower up enough.
