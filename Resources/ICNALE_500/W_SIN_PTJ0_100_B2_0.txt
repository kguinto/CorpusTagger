In most modern colleges, academic pursuits and achievements alone do not meet the goal of a holistic education. Other than co-curricular activities, internships and community involvements, the part-time job seems to be one of the ways for college students to pick up or practice skills beyond the classroom. The part-time job can be seen to be a sort of a school of hard knocks, where students get a taste of the working world by regularly embracing volatility and adapting to new situations. It also provides a side income to students. However, a part-time job does not appear to be of such importance when we consider well-off students who do not require the additional income. Students may also wish to focus on their studies in the school term, and only turn to short-term jobs in their vacation instead of struggling to juggle both work and studies simultaneously. In other cases, students may find that the opportunity cost of taking up a part-time job is too high, especially if the time can be spent on an internship that is of greater relevance and potential benefit to the mastery of his or her major. Some exceptions are however acknowledged. In times when a student faces financial distress and finds difficulty in covering college tuition fees and basic living expenses, this necessitates a source of income. It is financially wise to grow capacity before budgeting, and one of the ways for the college student to do so is to hold a part-time job. In this situation, a part-time job is a necessity, and its importance ranks equally high or even higher than other priorities of the student.
