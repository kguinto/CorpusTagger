As you know, the tuition in the university is very expensive, and it will burden the pressure on your parents. In my opinion, it is a good choice for the college students especially someone who is from a poor family to take part-time jobs. Taking part-time jobs can relieve studentsˊfinancial burden, especially those who are from poor families. As a college student, you have a lot of spare time; you can make use of them to do a part-time job. There are a lot of advantages about doing a part-time job. On the one hand, students can promote their study through their part-time jobs. For example, if you are an English major student, you find a part-time job about tutor, and this practice will make you better understand what you have learned from books. On the other hand, the part-time job can offer you an opportunity to go beyond what you have been taught in class and you will learn something that does not exist in books, but in practice. In addition, students can also accumulate work experience through part-time jobs, which will benefit their future job hunting. Actually, part-time jobs also act as warming-up exercises for students to take a part-time job after they graduate from school and help them prepare for their future careers. It is easier to find jobs for those who have work experience in part-time jobs. In conclusion, it is important for college students to take part-time jobs.
