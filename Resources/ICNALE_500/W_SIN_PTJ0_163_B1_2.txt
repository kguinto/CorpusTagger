Having a part-time job assists students to pick up on life skills and supplement their personal income. For example, working as a part-time waiter or waitress allows them to understand the value of patience. This is because the people working in the service sector has to be patient when they are dealing with the customers. When they work at the restaurant, they will be able to earn more money to supplement their personal income. In addition, having a part-time job teaches students not to spend money in a frivolous manner. When they work as a waiter or waitress, they have to spend a long amount of time standing on their feet. It is very tiring and this may teach them to spend money wisely as they understand that earning money is not an easy task. Thus, it is vital for students to have a part-time job. On the other hand, having a part-time job can also lead to less time for students to spend on their studies. This is because they will spend the time to work and earn money rather than spending on studying. Due to work, they may get too tired to concentrate in class. In addition, students may also think that earning their own income entitles them to spend more on unnecessary stuff. Thus, I argued that it is not important for students to get a part-time job unless their parents are unable to support them. This is because values of being thrifty and patience can also be inculcated in other ways besides having a part-time job.
