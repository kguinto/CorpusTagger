I think, a part-time job is important for college students because it make me received experience and money. I think it is a good thing. Especially for poor students, can learn to work together. Experience from working will help us be more responsible for myself and help alleviate family burden. If I want money, I can find it by myself. I do not ask for money from parents. If I need anything. I'll buy it with myself. It is good and impressive, I can make money with myself. I received a lot of knowledge from part-time job and it taught the way of life and live together in society. It make me adapt to others as well and it make me an adult. Students should be working on learning experiences and difficulties in the money of their parents. It makes me love their parents more. If I can work part time with learn, my parents will proud me. From part-time job it makes me know that making money is difficult. I was saving the people. Spending money only what is required and don't luxuries. I can bring savings to spend on necessities. When there is no money. And give the money for my parents to use.
