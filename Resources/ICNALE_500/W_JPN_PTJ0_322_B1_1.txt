I think it is important for collage students to have a part-time job, and I agree this statement. Almost all the young people begin to work as soon as they graduated. But in school, are there classes which similar with work ? I think answer is no. Students can study in college, but can't work in college. Then many students go society with no work experience as far as they have a part-time job. Some people sayIt's very wasteful for the young to buy one hour for only 1000 yen. Surely, time is money especially for young people. But I think doing various experience through work in young is more important. And others sayExperiencing Internship instead of part-time job is better. This opinion is smart. Students can experience work through with Internship which efficiently and no waste of time. However, people can view small world only Internship, because Internship's span is generally short, young experience only minimum and all student can't experience Internship. Finally, students have to study, but students must not forget the feeling of thanks for parents etc... Many students depend on their parents, and parents work for their children's school expenses. I think college students should know their parents' thought through part-time job.
