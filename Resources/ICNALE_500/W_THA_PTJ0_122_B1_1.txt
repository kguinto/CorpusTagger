I study at MFU. I ever hear about part – time job from teacher and my friend. Part - time job have both advantages and disadvantages for somebody. Part – time job is a very important in somebody daily life because someone need very money in order to pay about education, telephone, foods clothes etc. Part – time job have advantages for some student such as help their parents, get more money in order to buy expensively telephone or a new clothes but some student want money to pay term value. Someone think about part-time it not good but someone think it can make they help them self. Part – time job it have disadvantages for somebody because they think about it forget study sometimes it make we lazy go to school or university. Some student shy their friends when they go to work part – time. It makes some student hate this job and don't want to make this job too. Part – time job have both advantages and disadvantages for somebody. If we know the part – time job fluently it make me have a good job in the future because we have a basic from practice part –time and we manage our time when we work.
