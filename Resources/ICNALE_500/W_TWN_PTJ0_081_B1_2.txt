We college students often heard about peers' part-time job. Some are ridiculous, others maybe funny or meaningful. Whatever the experience are good or not, it's undoubted that getting par-time job has being more and more important for us. Why? You might ask. There still some think it's a waste of time. However, being intelligent in the subject has not enough for this age. In another way, what your boss wants is the real experience in your resume, not just some "good-looking" lines. Also, not until you star to work can you learn how to be excellent in your job, and dealing well with your companions. Thought there are still many ways to train to getting with your teammates, the real working environment can be more complicated. College student need to think more because it might cause big damage whenever one single mistake. In fact, in the material way, most college students getting part-time job just want to earn more money to fill their pockets. It's easy to understand when you can't get enough money from your parents; you need to get by yourself. From then on, you'll gradually have the sense of using money. You'll be more careful not to being out of control. I think our college life shouldn't just 'in the campuses' but more. Part-time job is a good way to us prepare for stepping into the real social system. It is important for us.
