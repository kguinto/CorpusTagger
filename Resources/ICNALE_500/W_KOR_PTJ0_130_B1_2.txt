I agree that it's important for college students to have a part-time job. Having a part-time job has many advantages. First, it can provide college students a chance to get the working experience before they graduate from colleges. In that way, they can successfully apply a good job in the future. They also can learn how to communicate with different people in the society. Because campus is as small as it is compared with society. Not everyone is polite and friendly to you. Second, having a part-time job can make students know how difficult life is. Life is not easy, and making money is also a hard job. Therefore, they would not waste money and time. They would understand how great their parents are. Third, as an adult, it's our duty to earn money ourselves instead of getting money from our parents. We are no longer a minor; we have the ability to get a part-time job. So why don't you have a try to get a part-time job and buy everything you want Fourth, if you get a part-time job when you are a college student, I'm sure your college life would be more interesting and wonderful because you are busier than other students. As a young man, you'd better learn more knowledge and experience as much as you can.
