I agree with the statement. There are several reasons for my idea. First of all, I think that collage students should not only study subjects that they are specialized in but also do many kinds of things out of college. That is why they can experience various things thorough such events. For example, travel abroad, joining a club, doing volunteer work, and having a part-time job. I think that when they have a part-time job, they can learn the mechanism of society and acquire a lot of skills. The knowledge and many skills they get thorough a part-time job will help them in the future. Secondly, college students should earn their money and they should be independent of their parents. In Japan, these days the number of children is decreasing and more and more college students depend on their parents too much. I hear that in America college students earn their money to pay all money that is needed in college. If college students continue to depend on their parents, they will be in trouble in the future. Therefore I think that college student should be independent of their parents. So I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
