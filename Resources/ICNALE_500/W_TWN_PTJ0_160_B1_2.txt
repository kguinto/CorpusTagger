Nowadays, there are more and more teenagers having their part time jobs in vacation like summer and winter vacation. You can choose what you want to do like working in a restaurant or being a tutor. In my opinions, part time job is an interesting and challenging work because you will learn a lot in the process of working. Learning is an important part during the work. You will learn the things that you never learn before. For example, if you being a waiter you will have to learn how to serve people and clean up tables. As for being a tutor, you must own your own professional knowledge like master in English or math, and you have the duty to teach your students well to make sure he/she understands what you're teaching. However, there are a lot of traps in part time jobs. Finding part time job in the internet is easy but full of many lying messages. Getting the right part time job not only needs luck but also have to interview. You will learn something and making money in part time jobs. Therefore, people love to seek part time jobs they like and get the skills they need.
