<Important Thing to University Students> Have you ever done a part time job? Nowadays, a lot of university students work part time job as well as study their major for many reasons, so they are always busy. I think part time job is quite important to university students. First, university students have no money. University students have little opportunity to earn money, because of their status as a student that is hard to get a full time job. In addition, if students' parents are not rich and not give them much money, students are inevitably poor. That means, part time job is source of income for university students and it is very important to them. University students have many places that require money. Above all, the university tuition is really high, so it is hard to student make money for tuition. Furthermore, students should buy several major books every single semester and those books so expensive. Moreover, they need to cost of living and room rent and so on. There are many things that university students should pay money, so to earn money for these things they should have part time job. To university students, the part time job is so important, because they don't have money and have many things that they should pay money. Now, let's have some applause for every student who works part time job and live life to the full.
