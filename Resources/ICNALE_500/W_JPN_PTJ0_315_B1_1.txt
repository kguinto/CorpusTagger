I think that it is important for college people to have a part-time job. I have three reasons for this idea. The first is simply to earn money. Most of college people are sent and given money by their parents. But, of course, they are limited so college people earn money to use for play and so on. Another people pay school fee by themselves. They have to make money to pay school fee. People get money for a lot of reasons. Part-time job give people not only money but also experiences. After graduate college, people will work in society. I look on part-time job as practice of work. Part-time job teach us the things that school don't give us. They are pleasure of achievement and hardness of work. The third reason is to make friends at work and I think this reason is most important. I had two part-time jobs in last year, so I made many friends. In college, I can make friends only college students. But in part-time jobs, I could make friends with various people. I learned a lot of things by talking with them. Because of this three reasons, I believe it is important for college people to have a part-time jobs.
