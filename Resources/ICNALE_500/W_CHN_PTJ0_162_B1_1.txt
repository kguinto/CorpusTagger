Nowadays, more and more college students are engaged in part-time jobs. They work in their spare time as private tutors, salesmen, waiters or shop assistants. People wonder whether it is good for students to do so. Some people are afraid that working in spare time will have a bad effect on students. Because they think study is the most important task to the college students. If they want to live a better life in the future, they should pay full attention to their study. Of course, their worry is reasonable. But there are also other people who believe that taking part-time jobs has many advantages and the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. In my opinion, it is important for college students to take part-time jobs. Firstly, the students can earn money to support themselves and reduce their parents' financial burden by doing part-time jobs. Secondly, while doing their part-time jobs, the students can apply their knowledge what they learn on campus to their work. Finally, doing part-time jobs helps the students to gain some social experience that will be of great help to their future career. In a word, Taking part-time jobs provides students with more chances of social practice. However, college students should keep a balance between study and jobs because study is the first important task for college students after all.
