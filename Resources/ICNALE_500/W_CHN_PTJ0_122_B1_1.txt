Will an employer hire a man with working experience or a man who is young at work? The answer will be all too obvious. We can benefit quite a lot from part-time jobs. Back in our primary school days and high school days, we spend most of the time and the energy to concentrate on studies, our parents take care of us and we do not have to worry about living. At that time we are still children or teenagers, but now, since we entered college we are grown-ups. It is time we should take our responsibilities and sharpening ourselves. Maybe your part-time job is just working as a waiter or a salesman, but the rewards can be a great deal, as long as you're eager to learn and good at reviewing the experience. On the other hands, experienced the rigors of society, you can have a brand-new sight towards your life, and be better prepared for your future. As a saying goes, Book reading is not enough, a better understanding requires practice in person. In my opinion, taking a part-time job is a means of practice; you can regard it as a good chance and draw lessons from it. Just go for it!
