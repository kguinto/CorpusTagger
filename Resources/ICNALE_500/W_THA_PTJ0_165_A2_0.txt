A part-time job carries fewer per week than full-time job. In thailand, the number of part-time worker is increasing quickly. There are many reason for working part-time. Part-time can be used in a student in high education. The most part-time job in Thailand is the seller of the company and use internet in part-time job, such as, hi5, facebook etc. to published the product. In my opinion, It is not important for college students to have a part-time job. Because It may be affect in studying. They should intend in studying more than part-time job. Some of my friends, who has a part-time job, are used to persuade me to do part-time job but I refuse it. Because the result of the exam of them and the reward of that job are not good. Some people use facebook to publish their good. I don't like them. Because, it's make me annoyed and the user of that facebook is not open the real information. Some of them use many users in facebook. For some people who have no money to study, the part-time job is the choice to make money. They should consider the part-time job that they are interested. Because some job maybe cheat them.
