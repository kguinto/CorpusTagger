I have held several part time jobs within a span of five years. The part time jobs that I have had so far ranges from administrative jobs all the way to the service industry in the form of waitressing. I feel that each and every job has its pros and cons; through each different job, I get to experience different working ethics and environments. Through the interactions with the people in the different sectors, I get to learn a lot, not just technical skills but also soft skills such as communication skills, leadership skills etc that would be impossible to gain from just reading a textbook. Other than the interesting experience, the part time jobs are also an avenue through which I can earn extra pocket money during my holidays, in addition to the rich working experience that such jobs provide. Through such part time jobs, I can have the opportunity to experience the working world and to prepare myself better in the future when I graduate from university. Also, such part time jobs allow me to build up my social network of colleagues and employers, thus it helps in my future prospects as well. Moreover, it is also a useful and meaningful way of passing through my holidays. Hence, I feel that part time jobs are a boon and all students should experience at least one part time job because it impresses upon the reality of working life.
