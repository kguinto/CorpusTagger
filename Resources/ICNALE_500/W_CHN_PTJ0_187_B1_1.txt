Whether students who study inside the campus can get a part-time job or not is a topic which is being discussed. Some students say yes to it because they think it can help them understand their parents' hardship while some don't agree with it, saying it's a waste of time for study. In my opinion, a student can get a part-time job on condition that it doesn't have a side effect on his normal study in the daytime. As a matter of fact, the good effects that a part-time job brings to a student should be more than the side ones because taking a part-time job can bring students more chances to get in touch with society. It's good for students to have part-time jobs because this helps cultivate independence among young people. Part-time jobs in business can foster a sense of competition, which is important for students in the future. And being able to earn their own money gives students a feeling that they've become adults and, therefore, makes them feel more mature. Part-time jobs make students more confident in themselves because through the work they can realize their own value and prove that they are capable people. What's more, it also makes students experience the hardship of making money. However, students who get a part-time job should control the time for part-time job as well as pay attention to their safety when they go to work. Besides, they should spend their income from the part-time job reasonably.
