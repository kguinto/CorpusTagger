In my own opinion, I rather disagree because of having part time job while being as college students is distracting. The students may have not enough to read the book and review the lessons. Since we have a lot of university activities such as sport game, welcome party, and many stuffs the classroom such as homework, projects, reports, presentations etc., we have to focus on study and university' life not working. However, I may state in a very strong negative opinion about having a part time job when being a college students, I don't mean that I won't support this idea. Actually, to have a part time job is possible to be done if the students do after their classes or they have plenty of time and they can handle their study. Everything contains pros and cons. The students have to take a risk by themselves. They might take some advantages while doing a part time job but some may lose their study. Anyhow, it makes me think that working Part Time is not necessary for students; they rather keep focusing on studying on a daily basis. The students have to rate which one should come first, which one is the most important for their lives now.
