I think that it is important for university student to do part time job. First, we can study about social things. That thing, we can not study at college. For example, we can know about difference to earn money and we save money than ever. Besides, we meet person whose age is far from us. We speak to them politely. And we rarely talk with those people that are precious experience. Second, part time job is only way to make money for me. I am not rich but I want to buy many clothes, and I want to go abroad, and I want to.. Because I want much money, I must have a part time job. And I think college students are usually the same as me. Generally, high school students can not have a part time job, and graduate of college work at office whether he or she likes it or not. That is to say, the only college student can have a part time job. So college students should not miss this chance! Third, we can develop our ability. If I work part time job at JUKU School, I learn how to teach to other person. If I do manual labor, I build up my health. Like this, we can skill up through part time job.
