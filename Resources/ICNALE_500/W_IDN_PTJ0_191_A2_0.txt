Part time job are some work that we pick for finding some money or used for experience. I think it is called Part time job because the job is not our main job; it is only for extra time we have, and we got some money for it. I think there are two meanings of part time job, first is the job that you pick because you don't have money for looking a real job, it can be your time are used for your school or college, maybe you have some practice to do, in my country, some college have the night class that called Kelas malam, that night class is used for students that don't have time for studying in regular class, maybe the students have some work to do, and that work I called part time job. The second meaning is job that you picked second, and of course the job are not your main job. Let me tell you example, if someone have started a job, it can be he work as a employee in office, and he realize that the salary that he got is not enough for his family life, he will find some money again, and he find a job that called a part time job that I mean.
