Eking out lives by doing several part time jobs seems to dominate college students' daily life. Things are that their lives are mostly connected with their social networks, which results in their need of cash. Therefore, even laboring all day at some nasty restaurants is one worthwhile thing to do. For me, there is one fundamental reason of taking part time job during the session of college life. Though it has said that college life is one miniature of real society, however, there is still subtle difference that only when you truly participate in it can you find out. As a result, I think taking part time job is the best approach to observe this kind of differences. Also, there is still one other reason that taking part time job can be necessary. It is that the more people you know from other networks, the more active you will be. It can be one of your possessions of live, which is far more important than tangible property. In a nutshell, though taking part time job is time-consuming yet the benefit it can bring outweighs the spending time. It can not only make college students meet their ends but also add the social experience. Thus, it's one recommendable way to approach this society.
