Many college students now are considering taking a part-time job, especially for the freshmen, who have amount of time and energy. In my opinion, taking a part-time job broadens our horizon and brings us a lot of fundamental skills in life. So I agree with the opinion that taking a part-time part is important for college students. I have the following reasons and arguments to support my view. On the one hand, Chinese students are always considered as hard-working examples but it seems that we lack the power to practice. Taking a part-time job, during which we can learn how to communicate, work and live with people in society, is beyond peradventure good for our growing. College life must be more than just study and we should focus more on personal development. On the contrast, a student who spends all his time just reading books and finishing homework, no matter how academic his, may not be admitted by companies. Those students are not as mature as these who have experience in jobs after graduation. So why not take a part-time job? We all should take the chance of the days without too much homework and take a part-time job to develop ourselves.
