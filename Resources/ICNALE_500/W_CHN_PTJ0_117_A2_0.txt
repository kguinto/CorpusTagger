Nowadays, more and more college students are taking part-time jobs. And in my opinion, it's beneficial to the students. First of all, taking part-time jobs make young people more independent, which is important for their further development. Next, students who have part-time jobs can afford their fees for their schooling, which in fact relieve the burdens of their parents. Then the most important I think, students can train themselves for future with a part-time job. The most things we learned for future is what we learned from the society instead of the school. Because what we learned from the society is what we are going to face. As we all know, in China, many students can't find a job because of their lack of social experience when they graduate from college. Last but not least, as friendship can provide you an easy way for future, we can meet more people from a part-time job and many of them can help us. However, I do not mean that high school study is not important, but all in all, I think there will be more advantages to have a part-time job when you are studied in the high school, because you can get trained earlier and more friends.
