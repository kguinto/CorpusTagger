I think it is good for college students to have full time jobs as they can learn on the job which may be relevant to their studies. It would also help them adjust to depending on themselves, rather than on their families for money. In addition, it would also make it easier for these students to find jobs in future as employers would appreciate employees with work experiences. However, students may not have the time to engage in part time jobs. Other than studies, some are involved in charitable activities, clubs and societies, or representing the school or nation in sports. These activities takes up a lot of time and it may not be wise for students to engage in part time jobs as they may tired themselves out. Some students believe that there would be ample time to experience working in the society and saving up money, and hence prefer to engage in school activities, which they may not have a chance to after graduating. Overall, I think it is a personal choice whether to engage in part time jobs or not. Personally, I have been involved in clubs and societies, as well as having various types of part time jobs, and each one gives me different perspective and experiences which I learnt from.
