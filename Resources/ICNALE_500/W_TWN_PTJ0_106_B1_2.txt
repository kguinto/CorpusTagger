In my opinion, I think it is good for a college student to have a part-time job as long as it does not have something bad in their studies. Having a part-time job can make me have more money to pay for my tuition or buy something I like. In addition, having a part-time job can help me know more about the difficult of earning money, so I become more careful before spending money. However, I know someone who put all their energy in their part-time job, as a result, their ignore their studies, I think it is not good, for the reason that it makes them wasting the time their can learn. Although taking a part-time job is a way to use our leisure time, we also have other ways to use this time, for example, learning a foreign language or taking part in a club. These are also good ways to use time outside class. In all, I think it is not very necessary for a college student to have a part-time job, but if one has confident of striking a balance between studies and job, it is ok to take a part-time job in their leisure time, for the reason that it as well as has some good points. As a result, what we have to know is that in this phrase, studies is the thing what we should care most.
