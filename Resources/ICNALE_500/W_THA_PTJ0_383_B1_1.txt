It is very good for the college students since they need more money to use for their education. Now a day, I see the majority of the college students work part-time job after their classes. Some students work full time job on their holiday so; I think part-time job is important for college students very much. Why part-time job is important and benefit to college students? There are three reasons; make money, use their free time, and support their finance. First of all, part-time job is important for college students because they can make more money to use for their education, to use for their everyday life, and so on. Many college students use more money for their education such as pay their stationary, pay for their study register that everything need more money. Another reason, part-time job is benefit to college students so much since they can use their free time to work and to earn money in the same time. Some students in the college use their free-time to play games, to searching the internet, and to something useless. If they have part-time job their free time will be useful. Last reason, part-time job will support their finance because some of them come from working class family that get financial problems if they work part-time job they will be better. In conclusion, part-time job is very important for the college students since they can make money, use their free time, and support their finance.
