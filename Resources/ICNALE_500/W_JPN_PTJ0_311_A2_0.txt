Someone may say college student should not have a part-time job, but I think that they should have a part-time job. Indeed, it is not good that you work too hard, because you do not spend much time to study and you get sleepy during lecture. They entered their college to study. But you can get important things for a part-time job, for example fun of working and difficulty of it, thanks to parents. I have three part-time jobs now, wedding, izakaya and teacher for cram school. I usually work for 5 days a week. In wedding, I learned manner in cuisine of French and a job in wedding is very hard. In izakaya, I knew I liked service for guests. In cram school, I understood it is difficult to teach junior high school students English. I am proud of having this jobs. I enjoyed these. Trough these jobs, I want to enter customer relations department in future. I want to have various part-time jobs, because I think college student should experience various jobs, and they should find a job which is suitable for them. Of course, it is good to work for four years. Therefore college student should have a part-time job.
