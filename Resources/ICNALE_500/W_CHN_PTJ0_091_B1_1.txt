 Now more and more college students are eager to hunt for a part-time job. What they want to do is earning money to afford their cost of living, and at the same time, they could reduce the stress of their parents. I think this idea is worthy to consideration, and the starting point of the college students is good. But I don't think that it is necessary to have a part-time job for the college students, because college students have a variety of knowledge to learn. For example, we have several professional classes. Besides, we should take some elective classes. All these require us to try our best to learn them well, they would help us a lot in the future and they are really important. If you want to participate in activities, you can join associations or attend all kinds of competition which school provides. Here you could exercise your capacity. Above-mentioned are what we college students should do. Part-time job waste both time and energy, it may delay our college study. One of my friends always wants to have a part-time job, and she actually finds some. Beacause of that, she has less time to study, and of course her score is low. So it is important to study more and work less. What we should do in the college is enduring learning.
