 In the university, there is a phenomenon that a large number of students are looking for a part-time job. And there are different purposes. Some students are in favor in taking a part-time job. They believe it can add up their experience and open up their mind. Some object to having a part-time job. They think it has the bad effect on their study. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the latter. Two main reasons may account for it. For one thing, working more outside campus means studying less in school. As a English major, we need much time on our specialized knowledge. We should spend spare time in practicing oral English, reading, writing, listening and so on. It takes up much more time to take a part-time job, so we cannot promise enough time to study. For another, taking a part-time job distracts us from our study. Since some students have done a part-time job, they pay less attention on study; even they cannot concentrate on listening in class. Gradually, those students lost the interest in study. It costs a huge price of neglecting study. In conclusion, having a part-time job has the downside on college students' study. Therefore we should focus on our study during the period of university; after all, we are students.
