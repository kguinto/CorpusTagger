Nowadays, many college students have a part-time job. There are various part-time jobs. For example, Convenient store, bar, restaurant, gas station, department store and so on. Many students go to work part-time after school. We need to see whether these part-time jobs have a good effect on college students. There is no reason to oppose working a part-time job. I suggest college students should have put motive of part-time job not earning money but getting hands-on experience. Part-time job is paid hourly. So it is difficult for students to make a lot of money. Time can be spending easily. It isn't desirable for students to earn much money, because they have to do much work. Younger days Time is also very important. I agree that hand-on experience is more effective than lecture-based learning. On account of part-time job, many college students can learn the society and be a wise man. Thanks to part-time job, many college students can learn socialization. They actually do a part-time job and earn money. This process makes the students find a real society. Earning money do college students good. Because earning money is difficult, student save money. Owing to diver's experience, students can learn to be sociable. Part-time job help people realize labor relation, the ways of the world. But, it is desirable to keep out of the way when students study major. I am of the opinion that Students should not forget duty as a student. Simple real experience made our live stimulate and have a good impact on ours. But above all, Study is more important than part-time job. Personally, I think that part-time job is useful in regard to sociality and various hands-on experiences. What it comes down to that it is important that part-time job should fit in study.
