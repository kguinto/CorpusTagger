I agree to have part-time job. In summer is my free time. I can help my parents save money with work part-time job. I can save money for pay study course in next semester. It's practice myself. You can work past-time job in many company, such as, KFC, Mcdonal, 7-11. My parents used to tell me "experience is important than knowledge" and I believed it. I gain a lot of experience from part-time job. In the future, I may study in abroad, so I must save money now. Past-time job made money for me. College student have free time so much. They are spend for watch movie, talk with their friends. It doesn't have benefit. They should make anything that have benefit for their life. A part-time job is choice which make money for students. Next summer, I will go to England for work and travel. It's new experience for me. I must practice speak English every day. It's so hard. I may live in London because there have many Thai restaurant. I need to work part-time job in there. I don't know everything I say. It become to truth or imagination, but I will try to do it.
