The answer to this question actually depends on people. Some people think college student should get the part-time job, while the other thinks those college students don't need to do the part-time job. As for me, I partially agree with the former idea. Because now most employers care about employees' work ability rather than their educational background. First of all, in the college, the professor usually taught student theory that on the text book, but this knowledge sometimes can't apply to practical thing. For example, text book couldn't teach you how to cope with client. Some part-time job experience will help you to deal with these things. In addition, doing part-time job can let us know that earning money is not easy thing. Then next time we want to buy some luxury things, we can think twice, think this thing is worth to buy it or not. Because we know money is hard to get, we will spend money carefully. Last but not least, doing the part-time job can broaden our mind and get into the society early. And we can learn how to handle things that happen unexpectedly. In this way, after we graduated from school and find a job, we can deal with problem properly. In conclusion, whether doing part-time job is important to college student or not is a complex question, requiring subjective judgment; consequently, there are no easy or certain answers. As for me, I partially agree that it is important for college student to have a part-time job.
