It is important for college students to have a part-time job. In my opinion a part time job in a college is very important for me because money from my mother, father or my aunt is not enough. There are many things I want to buy not only for my education in university degree but other thing also such as hanging out with my best friend, buy cosmetics, or shopping on my weekend because I want to be a fashionable. When your friend can buy everything that them want surely you are envy immediately, but you cannot do that. Why not? Because you are poor. So you find every way to have more money and part time job is one of your choices. Unfortunately some student find wrong way and do something wrong to get more money without care about moral and their family. Bad thing will not happen any more if you can manage your money and your thinking is significant also. Influent of money is not effect for you anymore. You will be happy and funny with your new life style. It is difficult to do, but I am try to be that and congratulation for me.
