Before we begin on the topic of discussion, it is crucial to first identify the scope of the discussion topic, which will be limited to Singapore in order to facilitate the discussion to a more effective level that is familiar to me. In this case, a college student is assumed to be one that is currently studying in a junior college in Singapore, and based on my personal experiences and the experiences shared by my friends, I disagree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job, with reasons laying around how they will eventually affect the student from achieving their full-potential. Although college students can be argued to be able to pick up valuable life experiences in working from their part-time job, it is not crucial for them to work because they are not mature enough to handle situations at work which they may be exposed to. Also, having a part-time job can be argued to have detrimental effect on college students' grades should they not manage their time well. In fact, since a junior college is an express path that leads them to a university, it is crucial that they perform well enough to enter a university and a course of their choice that will ultimately decide their future career, so it is not essential for college students to get a part-time job but to perform their role as a student well.
