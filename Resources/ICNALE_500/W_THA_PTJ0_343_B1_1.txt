I think college students should have a part-time job because it may be good for them when they have to work in the future. College students will get many advantages if they have a part-time job. In my view, we cannot do anything good in the first time, so if we can practice before work, it may be better than we never do anything. It may be a fault, but at least we used to try once and we can learn from our own fault. In part-time job, we do not learn only the way to work, but we learn to live with other people too. We cannot stand alone in the large world. One day, we may want some help from our co-workers, nobody knows. Moreover, the part-time job may help us to find what we what to do when we graduated. We should try to do various works. When we try to do many works we will know what we really want to do in the future. In addition, we can help our parents to save money. We do not need to beg the money from our parents if we have the part-time job. We can find the money by ourselves, so they do not need to work hard. We will be proud whatever we done.
