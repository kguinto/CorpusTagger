It is common for university students to take a part-time job, besides attending lectures or doing lab experiments. Actually, I agree that a university student should take a part-time job. First of all, most of the university students do not come from a very well-off family. Many have to support their own lives in the university, if not have to even support the lives of their families. A part-time job certainly will gain the students extra pocket money. They then don't have to rely on their family so much on enjoying their university lives. Also, part-time jobs give hands-on experience on working in society. While studying in schools for almost twenty years, university students have never tasted the harshness and cruelty working a realistic environment. A part-time job gives them a preview on what they are facing after they graduated from the universities a few years later. Furthermore, part-time job is a good time-killer. In university, students no longer have the incredible workload on taking open examinations; neither will they need to attend lecture hours as long as they have done in secondary schools. Most will just have no idea on how to spend these extra free hours after getting into universities. A part-time job can fulfill the needs of them. They can remain on doing something meaningful and beneficial, rather than idling their time away, or spending their time aimlessly. In conclusion, there are many reasons on the good side in supporting university students to take a part-time job.
