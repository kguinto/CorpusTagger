It is absolutely critical for college students to take on a part-time job. To be better prepared for the working society, students should be encouraged to work during their free time. However, it isn't an easy task for them to study and work concurrently so time-management is the key to success. First, students should consider jobs which they had passion and interest in. I believe one will excel only if he is motivated in doing his job. Hence, an art student could probably work as a guide in the Singapore Art Museum while a hospitality student works in the front office department of Ritz Carlton hotel. Such valuable working experience allows students to learn of what is expected of them. Moreover, they will be able to acquire new skills and knowledge which is highly applicable in their work in future. Prior to graduation, I had worked at Fairmont Singapore in the Banquet department, Singapore Cruise Centre as an usher and Resort World Sentosa as a customer service agent. As a hospitality student, these working experience are priceless. Lastly, grades are never a true reflection of one's ability. A diversified working experience defines one's self and one's worth. Therefore, I will encourage all students to work part-time.
