I agree to the statement, but only to a small extent. Firstly, holding a part-time job allows for some sort of financial independence, and the student can learn how to manage his own finances from the allowance earned. Furthermore, it exposes students to the working life and teaches them some skills that could not be taught in school. For instance, people relations and dealing with your superior is one aspect that I believe will come only through a working experience. However, we have to recognize that the core responsibility of a student is to study. Taking on a part-time job might unnecessarily strain the ability of the student to concentrate on his studies. This might worsen especially if the student gets his priority wrong and puts in more effort and/time in his part-time job than his studies. It is true that part-time jobs does bring about a few benefits as mentioned above, but it might turn into a disaster should the student be stressed out trying to juggle both sides. The same skill sets could be learnt from an internship, or a vacation attachment, albeit for a shorter period of time. This enables the student to give his best in either his studies or his internship, with no disruption from the other commitment. Finally, I would like to conclude that it may be beneficial to the student to take on a part-time job, but only if he is capable of juggling the workload. Otherwise, it is recommended that he take on a vacation job/internship instead.
