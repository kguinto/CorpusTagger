I agree that college students should have a part-time job. When you study in college, you have to spend a lot of your money. You have to pay many things every day. For Thai student, you get money from your father, mother. You haven't earned money by yourself. It's a good idea to have a part-time job for reduce duty of your parents. When you have earned your money by yourself, you will proud. And you will know when your parents have to work-hard for earn a lot of money. You will know how much they tried. Even if it's just a little way to reduce parents' duty, their will proud of you. When you have a free time from your study, you should spend your free time by find some job. Spending your free time in this way can make a lot of useful. Someone doing a part-time job in the supermarket as a cashier, in the coffee shop as a waiter or waitress. You can do anything that it's not illegal and it does can make you earn some money. I think you can find an experience. You can learn how to work, how to keep your money and will find yourself what you love to. In future you can find a job that suit for you. Then, college student should have a part-time job.
