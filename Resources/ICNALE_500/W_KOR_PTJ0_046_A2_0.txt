I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Universities have raised steadily the tuition. Some parents can no longer afford the fee. So. Students are working part-time to earn his pocket money. I think that the part-time job will be an invaluable experience before social life. And many college students are working for his school expenses. Students work several part-time a day. They work mostly at a convenience store and restaurant and cafe and parcel service. They work hard, and don't earn much. Because student receive unfair treatment to reason young. It cannot be justified any reason. They combine study and part-time. It's not easy to combining. I'm done it before. I'm too tired physically and emotionally. The part-time job demand too much time. Students sleep to catch up on his sleep in the class. So, students have become indifference from study. Part-time job is important to them. We are no telling that quit the part-time. Because par-time is maintain their existence. So, university should arrange ways that scholarship system increase etc. They have to help practically to students suffering from financial hardship. Therefore I consent that it is significant for university students to have a part-time job.
