A part-time job is needed at different parts of our lives. It also consists of many different types of jobs, which may be suitable for certain age group and not for others. As for college students, I believe that it is imperative that they have a part-time job for various reasons. First, having a part-time job would supplement their income and allowance. At college, there would be a lot of necessary payments needed for books, projects etc. Sometimes, students may be embarrassed to ask their parents for additional allowance as they are more understanding towards their family situations, or they feel that they have already grown up and there is little need for them to bother their parents. At the same time, having additional income will also allow them to have more freedom to buy things that they want, without their parents knowing. For example, they want to give a better present to their parents that is out of their means; they want to pamper their other half with extravagant presents and asking their parents for money would make it unreasonable. Secondly, having a part-time job would allow college students' resume to look better in the eyes of the employer. It is needed for them to gain experience before they plunge into the working world after their graduation. By trying out different part-time jobs, they would also gain first-hand experience about the lives in the working world, and give them more opportunities to try out possible industries they want to work int. This would also greatly assist them in selecting a course for further study or a career that they want to pursue. For example, if one does not enjoy a part-time job in sales/retail, they would probably not want to venture into sales marketing.
