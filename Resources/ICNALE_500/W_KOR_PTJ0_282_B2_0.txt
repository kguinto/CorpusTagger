Some people say that having a part-time job is a waste of time for college students. They argue that a part-time job can make college students waste time to study, and it also includes a lot of dangerous aspects. However, I disagree with this idea because not only does a part-time job give college students some money which is needed to study and to buy what they want, but also it provides them with the experiences of living independently from their parents. Above all, a part-time job provides college students with some money for living. College students need a substantial number of money because the tuition fees of colleges are increasing over and over, and the prices of textbooks used in colleges are also expensive nowadays. Unlike the argument that having a part-time job is not helpful to study at all, spending a little time on part-time jobs can provide money which is necessary for college students to study. Since college students are already adults, they should be able to make money for living, independently from their parents. If they do not try to get part-time jobs, they cannot but keep depending financially on their parents. What is worse is that there is a possibility that this attitude can last for their entire life. To sum up, considering that college students are already adults who should be able to live independently from their parents, it is good for them to have part-time jobs which can provide them with both money and precious experiences for their entire life. There is no doubt in that college students can have more responsible attitudes for their own life by having experiences of working for money by themselves.
