I do agree that it is important for a college student to have a part-time job. But we have to maintain our grades in order to pass all subjects. A college student means that we are going to step into society to work in the near future. Before that, I think it is good for us to have a part-time job in college life. If a college student had a part-time job, he or she could earn more allowance or could lighten the economic burden of family. Besides, he or she could realize how hard it is to earn money by himself / herself. We can learn a lot of things during the work time. Furthermore, when we do all the work in person, we will gain precious experiences of society. On the other side, some people may consider it is not necessary for a college student to have a part-time job. They think their primary job is to enjoy school life and attend extracurricular activities. They want to make friends and learn from the campus clubs. There is no right or wrong, it depends on what we think. I had a part-time job at a restaurant before. Except for the money I earned, I also made some friends.
