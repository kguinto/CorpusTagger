Today, college students and part-time job seem to go along together. Most of college students have their part-time job in order to gain money for paying their credit fee and expenses. But some of them have so as to gain experience in life. Part-time job is suitable to every people not only college students. A lot of people that achieve their goal are the people that have an experience from part-time job. I used to think that part-time job is the waste of time. But now I realize that part-time job is so important. Part-time job gives you more than money. It is experience that you won't learn in class. It also gives you more friends. You will learn how to act in daily life. The other thing that part-time job might teach you is teamwork because you have to work with other people. There are many kinds of part-time job. You can choose what you are expert in. Part-time job must be a clean job and not violate the law. You must manage your time well to have a part time job. Don't let it affect your education or it will ruin your whole life. So I agree to the topic that part-time job is important for college students. The most important thing in doing a part-time job is to manage your time well. I emphasize at this warning because I find out many people that encounter to failure are because of time managing.
