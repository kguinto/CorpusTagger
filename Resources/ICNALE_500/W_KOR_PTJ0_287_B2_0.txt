First, college students have to earn some money to pay for the college's tuition. But the tuition is very high. Tuition of National universities and colleges is except situation. But the other colleges' is so high that students can't be enough to pay it. For example, a semester's tuition of famous Universities in Seoul is about 4~5 million won. Second, College students need to various experiences about many jobs before getting some full-time jobs. Getting a job is important. But after that, doing something in a company is more important. For that, we have many skills. Students never have skills one day, only through doing again and again. If we experience various part-time jobs, we have more skills. So it is good for getting a job. Internship courses of many companies seem to be a good part-time job. During the courses, Students keep their position. In this situation they take some projects and earn some money in the companies. At the end of the courses, executives of the companies decide to take some students for their spare worker. In Korea, POSCO has the course. Third, when students have a part-time job and work it, they are able to think about concept of money and consumption. Through part-time job, they earn their own money and learn and think about concept of money And then, they can plan and consume something with the money. That course is meaningful for students.
