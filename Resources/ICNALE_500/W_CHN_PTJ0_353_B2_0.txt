In general, I think it's not necessary for students to get a part-time job. In this case, I mean it by the jobs that has nothing to do with his/her major like a waiter or dish washer in the restaurant. There follows several reasons that support my argument. Time is precious for students, especially for students who study in the university. You know, for most people, they only get one chance studying in college, so it's obvious that we should make use of every second for meaningful things, like learning knowledge, acquiring practical skills. However, doing part-time job teaches us nothing. We are just trading our precious time for pocket money, which proves to be unworthy. Secondly, nowadays, most families have got financially prepared for the educational costs. So, most of us needn't struggle in the part-time job to earn our tuition. Besides, even if someone's family can't afford his college tuition, there is still the college student financial aid system available. As we know, every college in PRC offers educational loan to student that is financially challenged. With this fund, they can successfully finish their study. And students can return the money after they get a real job. According to the reasons above, we hold the belief that, part-time job is just optional for us. If we have got time, it would be wiser of us to learn something meaningful.
