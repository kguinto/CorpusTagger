In my opinion, I think I really agree with the topic that "It is important for college students to have a part-time jobs". In the present, most of The Thai college students have not known the value of the money and It might be a good idea for their leisure. If they do the part-time jobs they will know the value of their money and understand how hard that their parents had worked for take the money to them and the another important reason is that they don't have time to think about the bad things and don't have time to do the disadvantage things, have an alcohol drugs shopping with the unnecessary things and blab la bla. It will be the good things to collect the money to buy something that you want without disturbing your parents. It can really help you to be responsible be on time have the skill to do the things that you had worked. However I really agree with this topic and you will see how development of you from the part-time jobs. You can have one occupation for you to do in the future. You can make your parents proud to yourself. Let's have a part-time jobs now.
