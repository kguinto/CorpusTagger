Recently, there's a heated discussion about whether it is important for college students to have a part-time job, Different people have different opinions. Some people think that college students' most important task is studying, not making money, while other people do not agree it. In their opinion, college students should learn not only book knowledge, but also other technologies. Frankly speaking, I don't like having a part-time job. Because, it occupies amount of my part-time and I have to pay much of my attention and energy to it. But, I do agree that it is really important for college students to have a part-time job. Here are my reasons. Firstly, having a part-time job can bring us some financial income. This is the most visible benefit. We can lighten the burden on our family by doing some part-time job and improve our own living standard. Secondly, we may get some social experience which is useful to our future job-hunt. Thirdly, we can learn a lot of skills through doing part-time job. The college students are all good at book learning. But, most of the students are lack of practical experience. So, I think, it is necessary to have some part-time job to improve our mixed ability.
