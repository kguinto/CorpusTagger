I'm agree with the upper statement. First of all, college students are already adults; they can be independent, and able to do things by themselves in their own way. And they have their own thoughts and ideas, so they don't need to depend on other people. Secondly, having a part time job can help college students to get many experiences. They can meet many different people when they are working. They also learn knowledge not from books. They will become more confident and mature if they do part-time job. Thirdly, part time job can help college students to widen their views step by step. In the part time job, students cannot only learn a lot of things which can't in class, but also see a more colorful world. So they get real information about the society from doing part-time job. Fourthly, because most part time job paid, this salary can be used as the tuition cost of living. In other words, having a part time job also can reduce the financial burden of parents. On the other hand, it also can improve college students' self-awareness. Finally, college students have plenty of spare time, they should do something meaningful. In the end, I have to say, college students must arrange their own time reasonably if they decide to do part time job. Don't affect their normal study. That's all.
