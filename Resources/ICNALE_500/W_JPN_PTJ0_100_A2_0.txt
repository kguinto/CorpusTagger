I agree with this opinion. I have some reason. First of all, we simply have to earn money. Also as a college student we need a lot of money such as school fee, train fee and so on that we need in school life in college. I think it is very high but it is important to try to pay such money because such expenditure is not for other person but for myself. Relying on only our parents from the beginning is not so good. Secondly we can experience a lot of things through our part-time jobs that we have not learned in school life. I also have been learned through a part-time job. When I entered the college I also began part-time job. At that time I was thinking that part-time job was very fun because there many kind of people and I can earn money easily. But I changed such thoughts now. I understood that earning money is very hard. Working is not the entertainment that we fun and is needed a lot of responsibilities. So we must separate work and daily life. Some people think it is common sense but it is very important things. I experienced many thought more than money through part-time job. So we should have a part-time job.
