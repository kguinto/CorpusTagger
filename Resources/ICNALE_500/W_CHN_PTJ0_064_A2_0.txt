As a college student, I have to say this is a really good idea. Firstly, most of college students have been an adult in law; they will get into the society after 4 or 7 years. One the one hand, getting a part-time job is a good way to learn more about the real society earlier; on the other hand, they can also add a good experience to their own introduction. Secondly, few students can realize the importance of money and they can not imagine how hard the life is but getting a part—time job can help them. Making a living is not as easy as they think before, so is the life. Having a life should be paid hard working, if you want to have a better life, you even should paid more. Thirdly, during the time they tried to find a part-time job and tried to do it well. Some students may be able to find the target of their lives. The freshmen in college always feel confused. They can't find the things they really want to do; it can be blamed to the Chinese education system. Teachers in primary and middle school never lead students to find their dreams. Under a high pressure, some gifted students may be ignored. On the contrary, the college is a place where students can show their talent. However, after 12-year gave-education, they can not find the correct ways which suit them. All in all, finding a job, and after touching the society, a lot of them will think about the life from a new direction.
