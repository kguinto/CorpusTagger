I disagree with the above statement. It is not important for college students to have a part-time job, but it is just an added bonus. Having a part-time job, especially if it is related to the student's course, will enable to student to gain real life, first hand working experience in the industry he or she might enter in future. This will be beneficial to the student as what he or she learns on the job is something that cannot be taught in school. For example, the student may learn how to react with others professionally and learn to use industry-specific databases. Employers often view this sort of experience as a plus point when considering candidates for recruitment, so a part-time job may be important with respect to this. Even if the part---time job is unrelated to the student's course of study, it can be a source of income for him or her. This working experience will allow the student to understand the realities of working life, as well as learn better time management as he or she will have to juggle work and studies, while maintaining a social life. In this case, having a part time job can be an added benefit to the student, but it is not absolutely important if the student feels that focusing on his or her studies is more important as a college student, or if the student's parents are able to support him or her. Thus, we can see that having a part time job does benefit the student in several ways, but it cannot be considered something important during the course of study in college.
