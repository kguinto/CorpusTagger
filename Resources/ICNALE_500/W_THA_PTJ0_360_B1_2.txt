I agree that It is important for college students to have a part-time job. Because studing in the university is use a lot of money such as, for doing activities, for eating, for buy a lot of book and the cost for enroll is expensive in some university that is not belong to the government. So college students should have a lot of money to pay for them. However some people think that money from their parents is enough for living in the university but I am not. Now, they are a lot of things change. The cost of goods are increase and they are a lot of thighs that attractive people to buy it. I think that doing part-job is good because the college students are not young person that cannot do anythings. If they would like somethings that is not for studying, they should do a part-time job for earn money. Doing part-time job is a very good thing. If you have free time and don't have anything to do. Doing part-time job is one thing that you should be choose. No one can earn money without doesn't doing anything. So I strongly agree that It is important for college students to have a part-time job.
