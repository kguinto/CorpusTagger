I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Firstly, when you graduate from a university, work experience could be your competitive advantage when applying for a job. Secondly, it's additional income. For some trying to make meet ends, this extra income could make or break your university life. Some parents are not able to afford the rising cost of living and their child's education and any form of additional income will be significant. However, for the majority of us fortunate students, this extra money can allow us to indulge ourselves in buying the things we want or setting it aside to generate even more income. They say that you're the richest when you're young because you have all the years to generate income. Lastly, having a part time job builds an individual's character and accumulates life skills that are unattainable from the lessons in school. For example, being in the service industry, people develop a higher tolerance of others or better communicative skills. These skills have to be experienced and not just verbally taught. However, the average college student faces a high amount of workload from school - the time they have to spend in school, on their assignments and to prepare for their next class. Not to mention, the extra hours required to prepare for the next important test. One might feel exhausted just by tackling school alone and would like some time to rest and enjoy life with the remaining time instead of taking up a part time job. In conclusion, it's not necessary to have a part time job, but it would be beneficial. The priority should be on studies.
