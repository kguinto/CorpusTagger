I define "college" as students studying in junior colleges, whereby "part-time job" as a job taken up during the period of studying. In my opinion, I feel that it is rather important for these students to have a part-time job. This is because they should try to gain as much work experiences as they could. As they are exposed to more opportunities outside the world, other than having pure working experiences, they can also gain other knowledge such as ways to handle various kinds of people. This is the main thing college students lack of, as compared to polytechnic or Institute of Technical Education (ITE) students. In junior colleges, they are protected in a "shell"; all they have to do is to study textbooks related stuffs, which is somewhat useless to them in the future. They lack compulsory job attachments during school holidays. In fact, working life is far from the contents they study. Hence, when junior college students enter universities, the rest of the people out street-smart them in terms of Emotional Quotient (EQ). In addition, having a part-time job allowed them to earn extra income, moving them a step closer to independence. However, life in junior colleges is extremely tough; handling Co-curriculum Activities (CCAs) in addition to the endless work load is stressful enough. It is nearly impossible to cope with additional stress from a part-time job. Also, they may not be able to focus in school and during work, thus not showing enough efforts in both aspects. Worst of all, their studies and health may also be affected. In conclusion, if the curriculum hours in school were to be shorter, I would suggest students to have a part-time job in college as it helped to groom them in the long run.
