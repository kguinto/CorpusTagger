I agree with the statement. For we have most time to do what we like when we are college students, but if we grow older, we have to work and earn money, so we don't have much time to have a part-time job. And we can experience many varieties of jobs by having a part-time job and we learn how to get along with our colleagues, our boss and the customers or how to get over many problems. So we can grow not only physically but also mentally. But if we don't have a part-time job and don't go through a lot of difficulties, maybe we often don't know what to do or how to get over something when we come to work full-time. And also, many part-time workers cannot earn much money, so we can understand how difficult it is to earn money to live happily and we can realize how important our parents are and we can say Thank you to our parents. And perhaps we hesitate to use a lot of money to enjoy with our friends and enjoy talking with them to save our money instead. So I think it's a necessary step to have a part-time job to college students.
