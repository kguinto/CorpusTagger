In the past, most of college students probably had no part-time job. This was because their parents might think that the students should only study hard to get a good grade and as a result, they would acquire a better job opportunity. But nowadays, it is quite different from the past. Each college students have their part-time job for some reasons; the first one most likely is money, the students work and earn wage then buy things that they desire without bothering their parents. Second, in college or university, job training is a must for the students in order to graduate in particular curriculums or we can say that doing a part-time job is a first step to successful job training. And the last one, while working, it is possible that the students have to communicate with other people, deal with problems, encounter hardship or even face an unexpected situation. Those are like the exercises that give the students chances to practice before they work in their real career after graduation. As what was mentioned above, we can completely say, it is important for the college students to have a part-time job. And personally, I do believe that doing the part-time job is one of the most beneficial ways for the students to improve themselves in order to work in the company and live their live steadily.
