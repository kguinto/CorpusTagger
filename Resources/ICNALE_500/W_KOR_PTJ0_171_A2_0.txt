I do not agree. Part-time jobs are very time consuming. Part-time work will interfere with the study. The youth will not be able to enjoy part-time job. Part-time work experience is important. But now the level of experience of the students did. Students will need space. Hard to day students. Because part-time to give up much. Dating, marriage, childbirth these things. This only reflects the reality of young people. At a young age can only receive, give yourself the benefit of a real shame it is not. Part-time job, but not directly caused by the high cost of college is to work, because the students are exported. Also returning to school were earning college tuition or other issues are under no. Precarious employment and a job, then worry about college tuition are. Study, work, careers, students were trying to get everything're losing every day. This whole thing is what all facets of social phenomena. Students go sick. Nothing is very hard to work part-time. The majority of the students of the branch manager will not let you rest. No longer young, the future of the future is not Before challenge in the future society is pushing young people into the land of death. That is the reality.
