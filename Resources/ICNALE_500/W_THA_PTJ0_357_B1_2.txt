I agree with the statement that "It is important for college students to have a part-time job" because nowadays Thai college students don't know the value of money. Moreover, some families are poor or don't have enough money to spend for everything. Sometimes, studying in the university maybe use a lot of money such as, for eating, doing many activities, buy many things for use in daily life etc. so, college students should do a part-time job for support themselves. I think that, doing a part-time job is a good idea. It is useful because the college students has much leisure time and don't anything to do and they can earn money for use in daily life too. Sometimes, they want to earn money for use in anything that they want. When they want to spend money, they won't borrow another person and will decrease some debts. Furthermore, they will get many experiences and get much knowledge to use in their life. They can support themselves and can survive in the society. College students will be proud themselves that can success in a part-time job. Their parents will be proud in their children too and it is important that it can decrease the tasks of their parents. A part-time job is using the free time to be useful and can help the college students to know the value of money and the value of themselves. So I really strongly agree that It is important for college students to have a part-time job.
