In my opinion, it is not important for college students to have a part time job. First of all, it may make worse learning because some people can't break time spend time to work more than learning. Functions of college students are learning. Should study hard and do to the best. Another reason, students are responsible for studying, not working so the part time job maybe get I can't do duty well. Moreover, working part time job is dangerous. Although part time job make experience for life but, if it is a bad experience it will make despond. It can make some students failed in their study and some of them need to quit school because the grade is not meet the standard of the policy. The duty is the main idea for having a part time job. For poor students, there are many scholarship from the governments, organizations, university that provided for them. if they think they want to study only but in the same way they want to help family about payment for study fee, they should ask for the scholarship rather than go out to work. But if they think that they don't want to have a debt with the governments, they should try to do some work but should not work too much till the study is failed. In conclusion, part time job must not for college students.
