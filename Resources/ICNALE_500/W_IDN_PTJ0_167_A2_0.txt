One way to prepare youngsters entering workplace is to let them involved earlier in their life. Of course there are people who agree with the statement so as the people who do not. They might think that students especially college students should not take such a big responsibility other than their main responsibility to study well. Those college students have to concentrate about the major they take in college and get the best result as they can without having trouble in their job. On the other hand, others have an opinion that it's very important to gather experience early in their lifetime so that when they finally reach that work period, they will not be surprised. As a college student, I personally agree that college students have to brace themselves and see what the world really is. It is not a big deal to have a job when taking a course in a college unless the student can not manage their time. That is the basic skill that those students should have before they decide to get a job. Without a good time management, they may screw their study while they are working. A friend of mine who has just graduated from his college told me that his working experience which he got while he was still in the college helped him a lot in his career right now. The point is having a job while studying does help the student himself to face the next stage of his life well prepared.
