 Is it important for college students to have a part-time job? Of course, I think. There are many advantages for college students to have a part-time job while they are at college. Yong people at college have begun to entertain a new notion of learning, the content of which includes not only book knowledge, but social knowledge and self-improvement of personal experience. Part-time jobs will offer us students an excellent opportunity to demonstrate our ability and to apply what have learned at college. Firstly, taking up the part-time job is plunging oneself into society in which you can accumulate a wide range of experience and widen your horizon. You will not be confined to campus life. Instead, you will have the chance to meet people outside campus, to communicate with them and learn from them. Secondly, though out own work we can make money to pay for everything thing we want, even for your education and training. Last but not least, you gain the sense of independence, self-support, experiencing the wonderful feeling of becoming mature and being able to relieve financial burden from your family, and even to buy them presents. I strongly believe that study is our first important task. Although part-time jobs do give us some good in some aspects, we should pay more attention to school study than to part-time jobs.
