I think it's important for college students to have part-time job. I have two reasons why I think like that. First, I think college students use much money more than in high school such as club activity, the cost of cell-phone, trip other country or abroad with good friend and enjoy play something with good friend. There are many things which they want to and must do during passing good college life. So, they need more money which they can spend. I think it's natural for college students to pay own cost which they enjoy with someone. So, if someone think it's not special things because they just to rely on own parents to give increase money which they can spend, I think it's stupid thing. Of cause, even if they have much part-time job, they can't pay all things which they spent such as apart-cost, food-cost and study-cost. But they can pay own activity-cost, trip-cost and etc which they enjoy. I still have part-time job because I go to car school now. So, I think I become burden of my parents. Second, they should know the importance of money. Recently almost parents give money more than they need to live comfortable. I think they will forget the importance of money because they spent much money, I white before. For example, if they trip abroad, they will spend about two hundred thousand yen per one time. It's natural for them if they didn't earn money by themselves. I think it's if they earn money own in hard time, they can understand the importance of money. So, we should they have part-time job.
