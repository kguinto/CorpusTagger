I agree with it. In my opinion, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job because a part-time job is a place that they can learn a lot of things outside a classroom. College student will get good experiences from a part-time job. They will find new friends and new people. They will know about their aptitude so they can choose the way that is suitable for them. They will know how to adjust themselves to be happy in the social. Morovers, it can teach them about solving the problems that happen suddenly so they haven't a lot of time to decide. I think they must use their experiences to overcome in that situation. The college students are the people who has responsibility so they should practise keeping the money by themselves. They will save the money more than they do now. Futhermores, having a part-time job will make them can allocate their time effectively thus they won't make their free time useless. I think the experience that is gotten from working a part-time job isn't same as one from a lesson that you can learn in class because It's a real situation!!!. You can't back to start and you can't change the thing that you have done.
