I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part time job. There are several reasons. First, having a part-time job is useful to know about working. College students should go through working before they work a few years later. This is because it is difficult to accustom working. Second, I think it is important that they have some relationships outside their college. They should talk with many different people and accept a lot of different values because they are closing adults. Third, it is important for them to have an interview. This is because they can know what it is like. Forth, by going through several kinds of part-time jobs, they can know about what kind of work they want to do in the future. Fifth, by earning money by themselves, they can buy clothes, bags, shoes and so on, they can travel or study abroad and they can store money for them. Sixth, they have a lot of time to do many things. So they should have as many experiences as possible.
