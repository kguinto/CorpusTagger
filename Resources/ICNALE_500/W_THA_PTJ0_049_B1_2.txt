I am studying in Mae Fah Luang University at Chiangrai Province. but my hometown is Hadyai, Songkhla Thailand. My university is very far from my hometown so I think that to have a part-time job is very important for college students especially we have to live very far from family as same as me. After that the college students finished class they can do the part time job for helping their family about money and use money by themselves. Moreover to have a part-time job can make them avoid from drugs nightlife and all bad way. In the other hand, if the college students that have a part-time job can not manage their time better it can be disadvantages for themselves such as lost time to study and do homework. If they can manage their time better it can be advantages for themselves and their family such as college students that have a part-time job should manage their time for study time and for work time. In order to having best time for doing homework, reading book and doing part time job. It makes the college students who have a part-time job b do not lose study time and they may fail on their tests.
