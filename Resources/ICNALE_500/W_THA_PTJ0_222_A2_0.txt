I agree with this topic that it is important for college students to have a part- time job. because, in my opinion I think that a part-time job is very important for college students. When they are studing in university they must have costs higher and the term is very expensive. so they should have earn the special school. By the university should support and find overwork for students to be another way to help students such as about document, organized book. if they have a part-time job in their freetimes they can reduce the costs of their parents and have enough money to send about their studing such as uniform, food, materials and personal use and they will have experience from do a part-time. They can to learn about everything and know about experience is very difficult and easy. They love and more understanding parent and making them more study hard. I think somebody is very poor and don't have enough money because their parents are a farmer and get earn very low so a part-time is very necessary and important for college student. However, they should study hard and interested in studing first for good grade and have a good job in the future.
