I agree with having the part-time work when we are college students because we have free time to benefit our lives after school. Working part-time gives us income, we have more and lighten the burden of the family. However, working part time, it has disadvantages as well. Because it gives us a little time to rest. And have the time to read with less preparation. And could cause our poor test scores or may fail. Students must give important for study first then do part-time work later. We can grow up if we have part-time job because we work and study in the same time. We see many people and work with stranger. We meet customers that difficult. It is hard to talk to them and make them happy so we must find techniques to solve the problem. When we know how to solve problem, we will grow up for sure. Study is good but should find experience so we can use experience in the future. We will very proud ourselves to earn money and help family. The family will proud us too. But we have to find good job, not work at night, and they have security at work. So to have the part-time work should agree. I support this idea.
