I disagree with the statement. As students, our main priority should be on studying. Taking up a part-time job could adversely affect our school work. A part-time job would mean lesser time to study. Not forgetting that students would also have lesser time to sleep, having a part-time job would also weaken the cognitive ability of the brain, further affecting our concentration in school and hence possibly taking a toll on our results. In addition, our bodies would be strained with the additional workload. School on its own is already a large burden, committing to a part-time job would further add to this burden with regards to lesser sleeping time and recreational time. Despite my argument against college students having a part-time job, I feel that there are some exceptions. For instance, there are clearly students among us who find their course-load easy to cope with and are looking for more challenges out of school to test their practical understanding of their classroom knowledge. In such a case and provided that the job in question would have some practical usage for the student's future career path, I would agree that the student should go for the job. Of course, the student should ensure that his/her school work would be in no way affected by this additional commitment.
