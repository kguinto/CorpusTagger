At first, I think part time job is very important for the student that family can't afford the education fee that much. But in the other hand, the student should have pay attention and understanding for studying. And should take some rest enough after study for clear the brain, good for health and be ready for next lesson in the next day. If they work after study how they find the focus for understanding what they learn in each day. How they finish and understanding in each homework or assignment. So they should have chosen studying first because it is the most important if they choose to attend in college. But if they no the other choice to pay the education fee or help the parents in each term. They might work one or two days in each week and that should be the free day without the class that can help they complete the homework or assignment in the weekend and have the time for review the next lesson and revise the lesson that learned already. And these are the good thing and make they be advantage student than the other. Student should be prepared and concentrated all the time. Everybody can't be perfect but can be the good student with a ton of knowledge and understanding in everything they've learned.
