I disagree. At first, college students should concentrate in studying their subjects. To do part-time job can prevent them from studying hard. For example, a friend of mine works at a restaurant. He works there late at night, so he can't study and also he is often late for school. So, he failed an examination and couldn't get a score of the class. Many students can't control their schedules because they don't better understand their own abilities than they think. So, college students don't have to be busy for working. Second, college students don't need such experiences that they have worked in society before they graduate. Some people say that the things which students can earn by doing part-time job – like manner, how to communicate with person, and so on - are useful for the future; when they actually work in company. But they can learn everything at companies what they need. I think that it is more important to get various qualifications like TOEIC. Such qualifications are difficult to get after they enter companies because they will be busy. It is more useful when they work. What I want to say is that what is important for college students is to study hard.
