I don't think that have a part-time job is important to college students. First, not all of the family can't afford a college student's expense. It is a fact that though poor people are everywhere, the rich is still have a large amount. Therefore, the student whose family can give he or she a unworried life, he or she have choices. They can choose to get a part-time job to earn experience or just focus on their school. Second, have a part-time job means that you have to sacrifice your time to do other things which you may be more interesting. Because we are students, we only have time to work at night or on holiday. However, just because we are students, we are still young, we are energetic! I can still remember when I was a freshman; everything in college is fresh to me! Every night I always want to go out with my friends. I want to play; I want to discover something that I never experience before! Somehow, there are still many people that are not like me. They prefer work hard on their studies. Above are the reasons that I thought that not every college student need to have a part-time job!
