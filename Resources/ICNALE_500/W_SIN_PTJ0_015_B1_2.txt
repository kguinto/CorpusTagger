I argue that it is not important for college students to have a part-time job. This is in the context of a student who has sufficient financial resources for his studies. First, a student who works while studying may suffer poorer grades, due to less study time. Second, he would have lesser time to engage in extra-curricular activities, which are vital for his future job prospects. Employers often look at such activities when deciding hiring decisions. Hence, he may lose out on a high paying job just because his time was spent on working in lowly paid part time work. Some may argue that work experience is important for students. I would counter by saying that work experience can be gotten during summer holidays, in internship programs. These can be pursued on a full-time basis, particularly in the industry of choice. In contrast, part time work usually involves low skilled tasks on an ad-hoc basis. There is little momentum and learning involved, that can be applicable to future use. Third, family time may be sacrificed by working on a part time job. Human beings are social creatures. We crave emotional ties and familial bonds. Thus, time spent on family bonding and interaction would present significantly higher utility than part time work. In sum, I argue it is not important for college students to have a part time job.
