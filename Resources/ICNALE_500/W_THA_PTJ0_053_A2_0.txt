The topic of Part-time job. The last term at school I hear the past-time job at my friends. They work of operator at one hotel in Bangkok. They told me News operator feels silly and shy. I think? Why they finished for them job. They say Experience is important than me. One man in them group, He stand and spoke his experience. But his spoke finished I'm look at him, he upper spoke English very well. I'm say Good job and Why? Why your work part-time job?. He said My Parents haven't some money and I have a free time. I approve the part time job. I think it good to have part time job. Language can improve and they got paper for experience in work. We have money from part time job. I want to do but I have no a free time. On Saturday and Sunday, I have to do homework and help parents at home. I want o find part time job. Maybe when I will finish my study. I can prepare before doing a real job. I totally agree for the topic. College students should have a part time job in their free time. I will try but not this time.
