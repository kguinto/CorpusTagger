In my view, having some part-time job is really important for college students. I think it is helpful to students by these two reasons. Firstly, working part-time can be an important experience to enhance students' social skills. No matter what sort of work is required to part-timers, it is critical to interact with other people; like supervisors, or other colleagues. The experience of working like this way is very precious because college students will have their real job sometime. Secondly, I think college student should learn about the way of controlling their budget. The life as a college student contains a lot of money. Because most of them are no more children, they have to be the master of themselves. I think they can be more independent with their own earnings, not only relying on their families. I have been participating in some work in school since I entered this university. Of course, I could learn about small works of school and could gain a lot of money. When vacation, I often get some part time jobs in restaurants, internet cafes, etc. there was no job which was not helpful to me. To conclude, I think it is certain that working part-time is really helpful to college students.
