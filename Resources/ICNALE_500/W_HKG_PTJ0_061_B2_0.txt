Someone believed that having a part-time job for a university student is important, but I cannot totally agree. Certainly, life and study in university is quite different from one's previous education experience as more individual motivation is required and less rigidity to decide one's own learning activities. Having a part-time job will be a good choice as students can earn their tuition fee and gain some experiences which can make their resumes more impressive and attractive. However, for the students who want to be involved in academic research, having a part time job may not be that essential and even at certain circumstances, can be counterproductive. I shall concede that they can gain some experience in team work, time management and communication skills. But these can also be acquired by doing research projects in the laboratory. Furthermore, working part-time can have negative influence on their academic performance as people's energy is not inexhaustible and there will be inevitable time conflicts. After all, their results in academic are far more important than working experience. In addition, at the university level, most students are not expected as experienced or equipped with apt skills. Most of the time, they are not likely to be on the appropriate positions where they will be after graduation. So a part-time job won't be efficient to tell them what their future careers look like.
