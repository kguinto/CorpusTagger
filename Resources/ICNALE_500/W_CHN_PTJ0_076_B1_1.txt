Part-time job is a kind of social practice activity, which pays back material and soul rewarding, for brain and body's work for special organization or person. Of course, on the foundation of reasonable time-arrangement. I have three reasons to support. Firstly, having part-time jobs, students can earn extra money, which can relieve their parents' economic burden to complete their studies better, and have an insight into society, which is good for social practice and their resume. Part-time jobs make you get new friends, make your campus life colorful, part-time jobs teach you how hard it is to earn money, so you will understand your parents and be more thrifty! Secondly, to have part-time jobs is good for college students, social resource help foster students in wider and complexes space, to make contact with society frequently is good for graduate employment, good for students to start an enterprise, good for academic study industrialization. So, it's good for college student's development. Thirdly, to have part-time jobs is good for society. Students can do work professional when employers need short-time worker, and that's little-cost. Students earn extra money through doing a part-time job; government's burden is relieved effectively.
