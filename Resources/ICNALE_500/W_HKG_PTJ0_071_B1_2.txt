After getting success in the A-level exam, students begin to look for a relaxing and memorable life in the university. They look for the ways to extend their social network and boraden their horizons toward the world. However, before achieving those aims, they require lots of money which may be too much in their views. Therefore, many university students involved in having part time job, so as to reduce the financial burden from the university. For me, I am totally support that having part time is important for university students. First of all, many university students are suffered from the enormous financial burden in the university. For eample, every students need to pay for forty thousand dollars each year for paying the fee to study in the university. On the other hand, some students who plan to participate in the exchange programme will need to spend tens thousand dollars more. Moreover, students who want to extend their social network may need to spend more in joining some activities. This actually proof that university students lack money very much. Hence, having a part time job do provide a good chance for those students to reduce their financial burden. Not only in financial way, having part-time job do make students gain more experience on how to cooperate to other in their work. This provide many soft skills which are useful for students in the future. Students can baraly gain those soft skills in their lecture.
