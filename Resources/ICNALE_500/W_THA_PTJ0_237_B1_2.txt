I do not agree with this topic. I know that a part-time job can teach many things to college students. First of all, you will earn much money so you can buy everything you want or keep it in a bank. Second, you will know how to work with other people. That may be good for your future job. However, I think a part-time job is a little waste of time. I think the most important thing for college students is learning knowledge and, after that, finding the way to use it. College students must read a lot of books and do their homework but if you have to work, you will not have time to read. Moreover, you will be so tried from work. You will not understand what you learn and you may sleep in class. It is too hard to do two things in same time. If you want to do a job, I think you should work when you have a holiday such as in summer that is the end of your semester. You can use this time to practice your skill. You do not have to worry about reading books or doing your homework. That is short time but I think it is better than having a part-time job in your semester.
