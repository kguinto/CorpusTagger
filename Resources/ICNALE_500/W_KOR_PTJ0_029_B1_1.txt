I believe it is important that all of college students have a part time job during vacation. The biggest reason is that a variety of experiences are good for all of college students. Also, students who have a part time job can prepare for the future in advance. I believe students who have a lot of experiences as a part time job will be able to work very well. Next, having a part time job can reduce a lot of burden for student's parents because they make money in their allowance. Even for me, I did a part time job at LG service center during last summer vacation. Therefore, I made much money during 2 months (about 2 million won); I didn't receive an allowance from my father during 8 months. Finally, having a part time job can meet a variety of friends. For example, I did a part time job in Phoenix Park during 2 months 3 years ago. Then, I fortunately met a lot of people, we became dear friends there. In my opinion, I think all of students would better have a variety of chances in much way. For these reasons, I believe that having a part time job is better.
