I agree strongly that it is important for college students to have a part-time job because of the life skills and broadening of horizon benefits it brings. A part-time job exposes a student to a different working world, not necessary like the one they would have when they graduate, but exposes to working culture and flow of work. For example, a part-time job may be one in retailing which the student has to cater to customers' demand and provision of good customer. When the student graduate, he or she may find themselves in the job of sales, promoting financial products or other products to potential clients. The skill-sets of communication are actually transferable in the case. Instead on learning on the job, the student already has the advantage of having related experience. On the financial aspect, it is good to earn money through a part time job because the student can experience a degree of financial freedom that empowers him or her. Psychologically speaking, the financial ability gives the student a sense of confidence. Moreover, taking into account the higher cost of education these days, having some money means an increased ability to spend on non-academic commitments like social gathering, recreational activities, which build up his or her ability to build good social ties and build up other capabilities.
