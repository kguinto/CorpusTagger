As we all know, college students have a lot of time to live their own life. They can control their life freely and do what they like and what they want. People are discussing whether it is important for college students to do part-time job. Like one coin has two sides, advantages and disadvantages exist as to it. On the one hand, it is good for us to have a part-time job. To start with, along with the high pace of the modern world, more and more companies pay more attention to word experience. They must do a good job to promote their ability. Their practice will enable them to better understand what they learned from books. Students can also accumulate work experiences through part-time jobs, which will benefit their future job-hunting. What's more, they can earn some money though these experiences. It can make the students realized that it is hard to make money. One of the most important reasons is that let them know the hardship of making money. Then they can develop a habit of saving money. During this period they can know how much they owe to them. Part-time jobs can partly relieve students' financial burden, especially those who are from poor families and cannot afford to pay college fees. Last but not the least, it opens them a window to know about the society, which is essential to their maturity. On the other hand, if we break the balance our study and work, it makes no sense. Study is of importance to us students. We must spend most of our time in study to reach our goal. We must deal with our study and work well, spend their spare time taking part-time jobs. Only following this principle can they benefit from their part-time jobs.
