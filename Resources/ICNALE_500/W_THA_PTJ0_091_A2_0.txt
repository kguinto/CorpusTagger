I agree because to work part time will take us to have experience from outside the classroom. Experience is more interesting than money or salary we will get from part time job. Many students think that part time job is not necessary when a college students, but for me it is necessary. It's necessary for gaining experience. I think I should be ready for work right after I finish my study or graduate. If I do part time job, my steps of experience will start from 0 but will continue to some steps like 2, or 3. When I go to work after graduate, my experience for working may start from 2, or 3 levels that I said but if I wait until I finish study the step of work experience will start from 0. I think it may too late or too slow to have that at that time. So part time job for me is a preparation to be ready for work in real life. The part time job will teach students to learn to work with others and how to respond for their duties. I think it is not damage study because we do after class or when available. It is better than go shopping or watching TV at home. Go outside and get experience from work, is should be for college students.
