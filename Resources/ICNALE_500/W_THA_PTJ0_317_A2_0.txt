Part-time job is a great opportunity for college students. Part-time job it can help students get more money to bring expenses on everyday life and on education. College students will get experience from working. I agree with working part-time College students but it has both advantages and disadvantages, Advantage is a new experience, compensation and a new social. Disadvantages is may lose health, Have less free time. There are many part-time job, Female students should work part time during the day and Should not work at night because it will be dangerous. Part-time job are very popular in restaurants, in department stores, waiter, sales etc. The present past-time job is popular in college students Group. Most college students work part-time because a number of reasons. Some people want to experience, Some people need money to use in everyday life, Some people need new knowledge, Some people need friends and many other reasons. They are think about past-time job just as popular but it was not wrong. If they think so because they will benefit much from this popularity. But if work is not illegal and not be harmful to themselves. I will try to be part of encouraging college students working part-time job. To the advancement of Thailand.
