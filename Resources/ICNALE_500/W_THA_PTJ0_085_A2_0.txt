Today, money is problem for study because anything, such as book, notebook, and anything for study from money. When they will leaning out the school/university, so they are use money for mile. They should pay for restaurant, and anything. However, beside part-time job should save parents' money. Part-time job help many experience for student, such as new communication, new knowledge, use language, funny, interesting in surrounding and people, and good new friendship. When students are working part-time job. They are meet many people bring about to communication from talk with customer. Beside, they can be practices personality when they service to customer. When they learning from procedure working and train for use language from talk with customer. During they are working part-time job.

Be important, they are receive new friendship from working. Besides these benefits can lead us many good things, they are have opportunity for use free time receive benefit highest.
