 As for part-time jobs, from my opinion of view, it's important for college students to have one. As we can see, when we stepped into the gate of the college, our aim is not simply to get good grades just like the goals which we set up in the senior school. What we should consider is all the abilities and qualities we need to have so that we can stand in the complex society. And it's a very useful way to improve those aspects for college students to have a part-time job. There are many advantages to have a part-time job. First of all, it can help to improve ourselves a lot. We can learn much more things than the boring knowledge given by the textbooks, and these things are more valuable for us to adjust to the real world we live in. What's more, we have to communicate with others while we work for the job. At that time, we can strengthen our capabilities about how to talk to others in suitable ways. Also, we can truly take part in the various social activities and have a better understanding of the life. It can assist us to foster better personalities, too. Then, having a part-time job will benefit the family. A college student's cost is very expensive and it's a big burden for the majority families. If the students can work for themselves, it will decrease the pressure which we put on the shoulders of our parents. However, though it's important for college students to have a part-time job, it must be on the basis of the ability that you can study well, and we mustn't let us fall behind others because of it. Above all, it will make a great sense for the college students to have a part-time job.
