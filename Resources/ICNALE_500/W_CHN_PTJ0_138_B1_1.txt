I don't agree with the idea that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. The majority of those who do part time jobs hold the idea that it is an effective way to gain social experiences — the ideal way to make contact with other people, which everyone will have to use in the future once we formally enter our society. At the same time, parents' burden can be lightened. Entering the college means we will have more free time to control by ourselves. However, it does not mean that we can look down upon our study and do whatever we want. As far as I am concerned, doing part-time jobs is a waste of time. For one thing, if you devote yourself to study and read some books about interpersonal interaction or philosophy in order to behave yourself in public, there's no need to spend much time in serving guests or washing the dishes. For another, the economy is growing at a stable rate, therefore, our parents have the ability to pay for our tuition. This period in college is not a proper one during which we make as much money as you can for parents' good. On the contrary, we are supposed to learn as much knowledge as we can. In a word, it's not a necessity to do part-time jobs for most of us.
