I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I think so. In my opinion, college students are apart from the society. However part-time jobs make them understand the society. We all know in the society, competition more and more fierce. Many college students can't find jobs. So their pressures are very heavy. Therefore, many reasons press college students into finding a part-time job. I think a part-time job have an advantage to college students. In the first, college students are called unusually lucky person and live in the tower of ivory. Their lives are separated from the society. I think if they haven't a part-time job, thus, they haven't society experience and don't adapt to the cruel society right away. Now, I'm a student study in Wuhan University. Though I'm a student at two grades, I'm a home teacher in Hanyang. My student is a girl in a high school. I like the student; she is very lovely and hard in study. I hope she will have a big progress in study. I need to make a lot of preparations to teach her well. So I learn a lot when I do this part-time job. In my opinion, a part-time job is very important to college students.
