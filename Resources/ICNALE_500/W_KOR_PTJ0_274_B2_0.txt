Nowadays, many college students have their part-time jobs. They have their own purposes for working, such as making the pocket money or paying for their tuition. There are also many students who don't work because of their studying. However, I think it's important for college students to have a part-time job. First, being a college student suggests that one became an adult. An adult has to make his or her own income and pay for the usage. Although many students think that they should concentrate on studying, they are just laying their responsibilities on their parents. If one doesn't have a part-time job, he or she has to get the income from the parents. Even if it's difficult to manage the whole outcome by having a part-time job, a student has to try to earn the pocket money at least. Getting a part-time job also enables a student to spend the life more comfortably. If one wants to have something for his or her pleasure, he or she will get it more easily by earning their own money. One doesn't have to request to someone else. In college lives, a student may have appointments with other students, or may have the unpredictable payment like giving presents or buying other books. Having a part-time job makes one deal with the extra outcome, except the one necessary for a life, more comfortably. Some students may think extra things except studying make their studying harder. However, a college student doesn't spend time only studying. That's why many college students try to get their own part-time jobs. Think of the other side of a life, and one will afford various parts of the life.
