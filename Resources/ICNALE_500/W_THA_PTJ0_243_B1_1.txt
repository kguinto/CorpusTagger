I don't agree with this topic that It is important for college students to have a part-time job. Because I think that college students need not work part- time job. They should intend to well study in college and think what is sub important from Studying. We may see college students intend to work part-time job, but They don't careful in this class. Consequence They will failed. In the other word, some-college students work part-time job by spending spare time from studying in class For example, selling gift shop, sending newspapers, working at restaurant in vacation. etc Furthermore they will gain money from part-time jobs for buying many thing that is important for studying. example, stationary, textbook, tool. etc and they can relax from tension of studying subject that very hard for college students example, calculus. Anatomy, Physiology, Physic, and other subject from their faculty. Moreover, Working part-time job can help you to find new friends that they may have more knowledge than friends in college. New friends can suggest working part-time job method for you, but working part-time jobs make you, need have time-managing in order to don't failed study many subjects in class and don't miss working part-time job.
