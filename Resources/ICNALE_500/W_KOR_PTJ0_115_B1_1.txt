I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Almost students entrance into a university when they are 20 years old. 20 years old is legally adult in Korea. It means they have to keep duty of adult. Many people say if they graduate high school and entrance university, they will play without parents or other people's inference. I also think like that, but it's thoughtless remarks. When I was a freshman in 2006, I didn't care about part-time jobs. I thought it is natural thing that I get a pocket money from my parents. When I finished 2 semester in university, I entered the military. At that time I was in there, I learned I have to disburden my parents mind to my college tuition and pocket money, because I'm a adult who take the responsibility about my life. So since I finished my military service, I have decided I have to get part-time job. I worked in school kind of scholarship student during the semester and I worked in factory in vacation. My parents still help me as paying college tuition, but I earned pocket money by myself. I think this is the duty that I have to keep. In short, when we enough grow to become independent, we have to earn money from part-time job and earn money. Although part-time job can interfere with studies during the semester, but appropriate part-time job like weekend work makes you rich and confident to your parents.
