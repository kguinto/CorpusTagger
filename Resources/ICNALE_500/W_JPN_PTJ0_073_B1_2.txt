I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. I want to show some reasons why I agree it. First, simply money is important. We need it in many situations. For example, we need to buy a lot of text books, tools for study kinds of pen and eraser, something for hobby or clubs, and so on. Do you know the price of those? Those are so expensive!! So we have to have a part-time job. That's a first reason. Second, it's good for us to study about the public. At the place which we are working, there are many adult's, visitor's, and so on. So we have to learn how to or what to do there. It's good chance to study before belong to the society. That's a second reason. And third, we can know about the importance of money. I think that we can't understand it truly without working and earn by ourselves. If you do not know that, you are going to make mistake about money or kinds of that. Because of that, we have to know the importance of money, and make an effort not to use money so much. Or not to use with no plan or idea. These are why I agree to have a part-time job.
