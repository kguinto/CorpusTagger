I'm disagreeing that students' have a part time job. Sometimes students are forced to because they come from a low-income family and that have to contribute to the family's income. I will not allow my future children to have part-time jobs while they are in high school or college. School is a full-time job. I would want them to be completely dedicated to their studies. When they come home from high school, they will have several hours of studying and homework to do. Why would I want to add more stress and pressure on them? They also need at least a couple hours to unwind, relax and have free time during the week. The weekend should be for studying and recharging their batteries, not wasting time and energy on a part-time job. They can learn job skills later on after they graduate college. However, if I were an admissions person at a college I would give a lot of understands for the poor kids that were forced to have a part-time job. I would cut them some slack if their grades weren't up to standards because I would understand how much higher grades they could have had if they didn't have to have a part-time job.
