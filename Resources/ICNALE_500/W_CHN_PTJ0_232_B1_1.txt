 Part-time job is a new kind of working method suited for those students who don't have enough time to take a full-time job. A part-time job can provide the students with the study and living expense they need as well as plentiful working experience. But it doesn't mean that everyone has a must to do a part-time job. It depends on one's situation. In my opinion, a student should know what he or she is doing and going to do in the whole life, and value the advantages and disadvantages when making decisions. If a student is having challenge in paying the tuition fee, doing a part-time job is a must. Otherwise he cannot continue his education. Well, if a student is not poor and he doesn't have a lot of pressure in study, he can have much spare time to manage. In this situation, doing a part-time job is still a good choice than playing computer games in dormitory. So part-time job is also good for the students who have a lot of spare time and don't want to be so relaxed, it can help students gain work experience and fasten their steps to the society. But if a student has to study a lot in college, he must treasure his time. It's unwise to do part-time job using the limited time and eventually interrupted the study. So, in conclusion, different cases should be analyzed independently. Part-time job is suitable for many people who face economic problems or have abundant spare time, but not for those who are busying furthering their studies.
