When you imagine of part-time job in Thailand I can bet you that you should think very few of it. In Thailand students who work for part-time job almost have economy problems in their families. That's mean students who have good finance will not think about part-time job at all. Someone agree with having part-time job and surely someone doesn't agree with that. In my opinion I very agree that college student have to have a part-time job because they can improve many skills for their real working life. Some students know what actually they like to do. Someone find proficiency from part-time job. Student who can earn money by themselves will be proud of them and appreciate of money. Students who have part-time job can learn real world social that have difference character of people, so it's very useful experience when they work. In the other hand some people think student's duty is study so they shouldn't west their time for others. And they have to take their time to make good grade for a good job. In addition, everything has good and bad side it depend on you that you can allocate your time. Students can improve skills from part-time job but in the same time they have less time for their study too.
