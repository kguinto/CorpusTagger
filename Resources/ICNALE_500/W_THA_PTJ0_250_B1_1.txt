I personally agree that the college students to have a part time job for three reasons. Firstly, some students are poor so they might make money from easy job. They can work in many place like gas station, 7-11, cartoon shops. For sure, the students would like to get money for their study; they can get the money from the part time job and can pay for everything about studying e. g. equipments, study fee course, clothes. Second, they will get some new experiences from their working more than studying in class. The teacher told me that experience outside is thing you can't buy by money. Working may give both good and bad thing to students but they can learn from their mistakes to make their life better. I think if we can learn from mistakes, we will be careful next time. Finally, the students are so proud when they get their own money by themselves. Not only themselves to be so proud but I think parents are so proud too. Absolutely, the part time job is significant for the college student to improve their life, to learn new experiences and to get money by their fighting. So, the college student should have part time job.
