I believe that college students should have a part-time job. First of all, they need time to experience the society and the work. If they become stuck in the college, not knowing what's really happening and changing in the real open world, it will not be great loss of time for their future. Rather than that, they should go outside and see the world and find the true meaning and purpose of their life again. Of course, it's only a part-time job, so that it cannot provide students with everything, but still, it will surely provide students with something helpful. Secondly, they don't really spend his whole 24 hours for studying. Undergraduate students, not like graduate students, don't need lots of time for studying, so that in the spare time, they usually go out and waste their time away. This must be stopped. If they can change their habit of using time thoughtlessly, organizing their time effectively unlike these days, they will have more fruitful college life. Thirdly, most of the college students grow up in the good family background, they have no experience of working themselves. They need to learn how it is not easy to make money and learn to thank their parents who have been fostering them until now.
