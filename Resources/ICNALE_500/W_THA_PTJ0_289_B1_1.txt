Nowadays, Social around the world had a change. It made evolution such as technology, education, communication, culture, language, economic, social, etc. Education in Thailand was changed. In the past, A charges of education is low but now a charges of education is very high because have a tuition fees is very expensive. Then a cost of living is expensive too. A problem in the money for college students became important. Money received from family not inadequate for living. It made college students to have a part-time job for make money and reduce a problem in family and the important, make money for use in education and make living comfortable. I do agree to have a part-time job while being a college student. A part time job such as make in KFC, Swenzen, MK restaurant, Pizza Huts, 7 - 11, working in college, or employees serving food in the restaurants etc. A part time job will receive different money. Some where receive 25 bath/hour, some where receive 100 bath/day. However if college students to have a part time job every day and use a less money and save money, student college will have a lot of money and use life happily in the social.
