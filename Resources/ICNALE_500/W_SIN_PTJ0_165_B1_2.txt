There had been many initiatives spearheaded by various colleges to encourage their students to take on part-time jobs, and these initiatives highlight an important message, that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. In this essay, I will be specifically using National University of Singapore (NUS) as the main college of study. Firstly, it is imperative to note that when students reach university level, they are treated as being responsible adults and thus it would seem ironic if they are still receiving pocket money from their parents. Hence, I argue that college students, as responsible adults, should take on a part-time job in order to finance their personal spending. In addition, when college students take on part-time job, they learn how to manage their time more effectively and that these part-time jobs allow them to learn certain skills that might be helpful for them in their future job search. In particular, work culture and school culture differs to a large extent, whereby in schools, students are age-segregated and students learn to work with people of similar backgrounds and age. In contrast, students are expected to mingle with people of diverse backgrounds and age in the workplace, hence this highlights another important positive element of having college students to take on part-time jobs. In conclusion, I have argued that it is important for college students to have a part-time job due to two main reasons, in order to finance their personal spending with their own efforts and also enhancing themselves with respect to certain skill-sets.
