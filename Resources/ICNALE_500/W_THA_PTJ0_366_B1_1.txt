The important thing for college students are Time management. You should to know how to organizing your time. Don't say with teacher "I'm working a part-time job" when you sleep in your class. It's not a good reason. Someone does only job. Don't have time for friends and education. Someone doesn't have enough money for using so they have to do a past-time job. And the important thing is safe your money. Don't buy everything you want. You can set your goal. EX. In this month I'll use just 5, 000B (for food, bus, shopping and everything) May be you write taking-note how many you using in everyday. You'll know and you can plan your money's future. Your health is the most important. You must care your healthy. If you want to have a part-time job, I recommend that first you have to ask yourself why do you want to work. You want to have extra money or want to have experience or want to spend money on something that you cannot buy. There are many reasons. Second, you have to select the job that you like or the job that is good for you. The college should not work at night Ex. Clubs, bars, dace places at night. When you get the job, you should manage time. I don't agree that some students want to work and earn money but don't care about university. Part-time job is for experience not for everything but can support when we have a permanent job.
