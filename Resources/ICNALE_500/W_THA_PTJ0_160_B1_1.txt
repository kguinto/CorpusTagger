I think working part time job is a good thing to do when we are still young and got energy to do. We can further our horizon and experience in new places especially in workplace. We will know how to earn, save and spend money. Even the income from part time job is not too much but with that small money is full filled with benefits and greatest value. Why I said like that? You will know how difficult money is earned. We have to study then go to work. We have to separate time for doing homework as well as doing work after school. It seems that we have more things to take responsibilities than other friends. Parents still support us with the payment but money from part time job make us spend money systematically. We cannot get money if we don't lose sweat is what I always tell myself. Each single coin is very worth for me. Since we got part time job, we can understand our parents' hearts. We understand how hard work they do for us, and how they spend money economy. They have to pay for their house living and for kids. If some family got more than 1 kid, is it much more harder that other families to manage their budget. So I think it's good to have part time job but we have to manage time and keep balancing.
