 Though we always emphasize the point that study must come first, it doesn't mean that we cannot have part time job. On the contrary, part time job means a lot to our college students. Now I will list some evidence to prove my argument. First, it is widely known that college is the place where we not only gain new knowledge and skills but also design a winning career plan. Part time job give us a chance to set foot into the outside world and to know more about our society. By comparing our dream with the reality, we can alter our aims in time and avoid many foolish mistakes. Then, given the fact that the competition is getting fiercer and fiercer, today, we have to make all efforts to perfect ourselves. Knowledge alone can never be satisfying. In this case, part time job matters in improving our ability in social communication and efficient working. We may gain experience and life skill in part time job as well. Finally, college students belong to the high-consuming group. I won't say whether we should save money or not, but I hope everyone to respect our parents' money. There is a way to solve this embarrassing situation, that to apply for a part time job.
