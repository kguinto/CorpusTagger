 Nowadays, plenty of college students would like to find a job on their free time. To have a part-time job, for example, being a teacher who helps senior students with their weak lesson, is becoming more and more popular and even be smart. Before I have got into the university, I once thought that I should get some part-time job on my weekends or holidays because it can strong my will and improve my ability, but things got changed now. I remembered when I was in senior 3, the burden of study was too heavy to hold. At that time, not only parents but also teachers told us if we try our best to be accepted by a ideal college, things will all be fine and the university is the heaven for us and we can do most of thing that we like.. But the fact is opposite, we don't have enough time to do a part-time job, because my free time is made up of studying, variety of activity which we are forced to attend and learning to achieve different kinds of certifications because we need it when we find the formal job. To find a part-time job, I think, time is the first element and we can do nothing without it. I suggest that some boring activities could be canceled and our student could be given more time to do something meaningful, but it need attempt and time.
