I do agree to the statement. Actually it is quite a good idea to support students to have part time job. I notice that friends in many countries such as USA, are having part time job since they are in high school but for Thai students is not really popular and supportive from families. Our families tend to support us to learn or study only because they believe that the more we can learn best the more we can get the good jobs. In Thai society, most of students are very supportive and protective from families. Many of them are not allowed to work while studying because they may not concentrate to school. They may not have a good opportunity if they got low grades or got F on their transcripts. So families support their children to have extra classes or further study rather than do a part time job. By the way, only few groups of students that they are not supportive. They have to find some jobs to support their extra payment. Some of them have to do full time job and study after working. If the part time job can bring us more opportunities such as having job records, many students may prefer to have part time job while studying.
