Some college students think part-time job is important for them but some people do not think so, they think good education is more important than part-time job, make they think college students shouldn't do part-time job.. But some college students come from poor family they think they have to do part-time job. Personally, I think part-time job has advantage of it, makes college students have responsible, makes they know it not easy to make money, makes they meet many new friends and makes they have ability to planning they life. Part-time job is a good way for good leaner students; I mean they will have a free time. But I think college students shouldn't do part-time job because I think college students should learn hardly for their future. Today, if you have low grade you will get badly job. But I don't say that you have no part-time job, do it a little from you free time, take more time with your lesson and do high grade. If you get high grade your life will be better. Today many college students and many high school students have part-time job. They spend many times to make money, and then use it nonsense. It makes their time useless but it better than they use their time with bad thing.
