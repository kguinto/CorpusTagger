I guess that most of people are all think that is important for college student to have a part-tine job. Not only most of people think but also I consider it is good for college students. I really believe that to have a part-time job is good for college student while they are studying. Although the most important thing for the college students is learning well and studying well, but we can not deny that to have a part-time can learn something that can not learn form the books or from the classes. If someone only concentrated on the study in the school, he or she may miss some special thing in their student life. To have a part-time job may broaden one's vision, and it may make college students have more opportunity to meet variety of person from other place. It can make college students to develop sense of responsibility, and To take up a part-time job not only can make extra money but also can learn some special thing. They can choice the job type they have interest in or they want to learn, and join the small team to learn how to get along with co-worker or how to work with team worker. The college students can make goods use of part-time job experience when they graduated and enter the work place. All above is the reason why I think it is important for college to have a part-time job.
