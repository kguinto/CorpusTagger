It is important for college students to hold a part time job as the extra income can supplement the high tuition fees students have to pay. While some may lament that part time jobs take up valuable study time, these job experiences can benefit and enrich students' learning in other ways. Students can learn life skills such as management, communication and people skills while as well as get a sense of the working environment and life. Working broadens students' social circle and provides important networking opportunities. Part time jobs also boost student portfolios and can provide onsite learning experiences relevant to the student's course of study. In this sense, part time jobs can provide work opportunities similar to that in internships. These jobs allow students to understand the work opportunities available for their course of study following their graduation. By understanding their work scope, students can make better informed decisions when choosing their major or specialisations. Moreover, working with a certain organisation will allow students to understand the inner workings of the firm better and help them in future job seeking decisions. It also allows students to apply the theoretical concepts they have learned in lectures or classrooms to real life situations at work. Similarly, information gleaned by working with particular organisations can be applied in college projects. Hence, part time jobs can confer both immediate and long term benefits to college students.
