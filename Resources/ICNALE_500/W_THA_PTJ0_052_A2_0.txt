I agree with the statement with the part time job because of having experience for ourselves and to earn money after school for extra expenses in the study. If we have some chances to help our family we should do. We should not disturb our parents to find more money to support us. We are going to be adults in the social so we have to learn how to survive in the real word. Having part time job can teach us how we should react to the other employees and customers if we do the service job. Life is not that easy so we have to learn from part time job. We will be strong and ready when we graduate from university or school. If we decide to have part time job, we should manage the time. We should know when is the right time to work. Don't spend too much time on part time job but we should concern about our study, our homework from school. Study is more stability than earning money in short time. If we have a degree, the job is more stable for us. It is good to have a part time job but we should know when to have it and make decision.
