To have a part time job is good? For me, it is just okay. I rarely agree with the idea because family can still support me. They always tell me to focus on study. I am trying to do that but not sure about the result but they say it is okay because just pay attention is enough. But for some friends or students have to work because of the family problem about money. Many Thai students come from poor family and most of them leave hometown to study in other city so they have to pay a lot such as for room, for equipments, for transportations and so on. Some of them got scholarship from the government or the university to support their study so they don't ask money with parents. Very less that no one support so they decide to do part time job but they work too much so the study is failed, need to restudy again or do assignments a lot. I think it is good if students have full time to study so they can be successful and they have time with friends in the faculty. Will be long relationship and keep contact. I don't disagree to have part time job but if you ask me I think I don't do it still parents support me.
