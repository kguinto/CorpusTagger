I agree with this statement. There are two reasons that I think so. Firstly, I think that to have a part-time job is very good experience for college students. The college students need to get jobs before they graduate. A part-time job is good training for ""real"" job. Actually, I have had two kinds of part-time jobs until now. One is a Juku teacher and the other is a cook at a Chinese restaurant. And I want to have other part-time jobs before I graduate from the university, because those experiences will be very useful in the society. Secondly, I think that to earn by themselves is very important for them. The college students need money. For example, party, date, trip and shopping. But getting money from parents to do such things is not good. I think that money for myself must must be earned by me. It is very good to have a part-time job and by oneself. But there are some had cases to have a part-time job. My friend spends most time having a part-time job. He gets money more than us, but his grade is bad and he won't be able to graduate because he doesn't study. It isn't good that students don't go to school for part-time job. Collge student's most important duty is studyng. And other friend that has a long time job has no time to play. He has money but he has no time to play. It isn't good. I think students should play while they are sudents. After all, I think that to have a part-time job is very good but to spend a lot of time for it isn't good.
