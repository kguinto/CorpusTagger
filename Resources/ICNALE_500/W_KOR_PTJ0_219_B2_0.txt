These days college students are busy doing both of study and part time job. Students have burden on a lot of assignments and expensive tuition fee. Especially, it is a big burden for both students and parents to make the tuition fee. Doing a part time job is important to college student for three main reasons: learn the society, make personal relations and be independent. First, students can experience how the society works. When they graduate, most of students get their own job. The part time job gives them a great chance to work with workers and know the atmosphere. Hence, students can know the society different from campus life. Second, students can make more personal connections among people by doing the part time job. They have a great chance to meet other college students who do the part time job. In addition, students can have a wide acquaintance with full-time workers. Finally, students can be independent. They get the salary and deposit it as part of tuition. Therefore students don't have to rely on their parents. Also, the salary can be used as pocket money. For these reasons, it is recommendable for students to have a part time job.
