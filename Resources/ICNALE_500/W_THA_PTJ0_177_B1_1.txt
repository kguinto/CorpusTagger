Nowadays, there are more and more students choose to have a part-time job in the spare time. Surely, a par-time job can provide cash and working experience to them. But, as far as I am concerned, the high school students should not be encouraged to take a part-time job due to the following reasons. A part-time job would occupy high school students a lot of precious time, which should be used to learn systematic knowledge and living skills in class without worries of work stress and frustration. Also the high schools provide students a community to fit in the real world, so that students can develop these necessary qualities and skills. I think it's definitely not a wise option to take a part-time job in exchange of losing some parts of such important opportunities of education. What's more, students in high school should get prepared to further their education in college, which could benefit them a lot. It's known to almost everyone that to become a college is one of the important ways to change one's life. On the contrary, a worker with only a high school diploma will have more difficulty in employment and promotion and a lot other issues in this era. In conclusion, I think our government and society should pay more attention to make sure that high school students could be able to have the best education without distraction of misleading and material addiction.
