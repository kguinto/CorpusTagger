Nowadays many college students tend to find part- time jobs and I agree that it is important for them to get one. The reasons can be categorized as the followings. First of all, it is a resource for college students to learn the right attitude when working. They may not be responsible for whatever they have done to the professors, but working is another case, everything told needs to be done. As a result, the best way to recognize the differences and modify themselves efficiently would be have one job as long as they can strike a balance between studying and working. Next, the experience of working part-time job can be a plus on resumes. Perhaps it does not match the job requirements; however, it means that they are preparing themselves for a real job. They have already had some basic knowledge and thus they do not have to be trained from the very beginning. Last, the extra money helps not only lighten the burden of a family but also a more free way for the college students to use it. They can buy what they want on their own or save for the future plan, like going abroad. Moreover, paying the intuition making them to be independent and realize that life is not as easy as study, All in all, the above are the main reasons why I agree it is important for college students to have part-time jobs.
