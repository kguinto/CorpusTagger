I agree it is important for college students to have a part-time job. First, a college student is not a child anymore, and he should be more independent than before; besides, he should try to learn how to make living by himself. By having a part-time job, it can release the family burden, and learn to be responsible for what he have done. Second, doing a part-time job can not only earn extra money but also learn social experiences that one cannot learn from the textbooks such as work ethics. I don't think a college student spends much time studying, and instead of fooling around all day, I suggest a college student have a part-time job in his spare time. I believe a part-time job plays an important role in most of college students' lives. Then, people can make more friends and expand their horizons through doing part-time jobs; moreover, if the one who has working experiences before graduation, it will be easier to find a full job in the future. The most important of all, people can find fulfillment in working. If the part-time job is interesting for students, they will have fun to do the jobs. According to those reasons, I think it important for college students to have a part-time job.
