I agree with this statement. I have some reasons. First, it is important for college students to learn working. Because I think this experience is useful in the future. For example manner and skill. Second, part-time job can meet a lot of people. It is different from your college friends. One is fellow worker. You may meet best friend in your life. Or you may get a boyfriend or girlfriend. The other is customer. If you give them a good service, they return smile. But if you give them a bad service, they may be angry. I am sure that these meet are grown your mind. Third it is important for college students to bring salary in the part-time job. I think college students need some money. Because college students spend a lot of money to play with friends, to live and so on. And saving the money for the future is important, too. If you bring some money your father or mother, you should stop it. Because you should learn how to use money by yourself. Otherwise you will have trouble in the future. This is why I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
