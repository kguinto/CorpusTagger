In the Western countries, people who graduated from junior-high school are independent from their parents. However, compared to those countries, Korea looks different. It is unique situation for Korean. Whereas Western students have a part-time job when they are in schools, Korean students are forced to study rather than to have a part time job. When they become college students, some are still dependent to their parents. They might give excuses about it. However, It is important for college students to have a part time job for some reasons. First reason is that they have to know economic concept as adults. After graduating from a university, they will have their own job and earn money. In order to be economic, they should be ready for proper earning and spending habits. Moreover, they don't know spending money sparingly is so important until they make money. They should know having their jobs and making money is not easy, so they don't waste it. They can have responsibility on their jobs and money Another reason is that they have to be independent from their parents as adults. Their parents already sacrifice for their sons and daughter for about 20 years. As a daughter or son, they should try to reduce their parent's burden. Tuition for university is very expensive so by having a part time job, they can help their parents. For these reasons, college students should have part-time jobs. It will be helpful for their parents and themselves.
