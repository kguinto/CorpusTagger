I agree with part-time job of college students. I'll give some reasons why I think so. First, we can lern pactical knowledge. We usually lern technical knowledge at a college, but we don't lern practical one. This means that we can get large view. Thanks for the thing, chance of success may be very very big in the future. Second, we learn to know difficulty of earning money, understanding importance of money. Therefore, we will be able to use money more carefully. This is very useful when we have a familiy. Using money with careful may link with familiy's happiness. Third, we learn to stand on our foot. Weakness that have ever been allowed will be not allowed in society. For exanmple, I take a break when I want to take or I don't go to a part time job because I don't want to go and so on. As these weakness dissappear, our spirit will be more strong. So we can be nice person. I gave some reasons, why I think so but the thing I want to say last is following message. After all we are merely college students. So the most important thing is not neglecting study at a college.
