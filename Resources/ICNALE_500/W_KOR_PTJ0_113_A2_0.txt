I strongly agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part time job. It may not always be easy to find spare time to get a job on top of all the school work. Sometimes it may even feel overwhelming for us to keep up with our busy schedule. However I believe it is critical for us as college students to have a part time job since it helps us to be more responsible in our actions. It not only helps us to be more conscientious in our spending but also allows us to be more alert to use our time more efficiently. If we earn our own money, we will be more careful in our spending too. It is true that harder we earn our money it is less likely that we waste or spend it easily on unnecessary items. Moreover, it is our responsibility to be more dependent as we get older. If we don't earn our money and just get it from our parents, it will get harder and harder for us to be independent. As a process of growing up and maturing, we need to have our own standards and values set properly and I believe that having a part time job while we are in school helps the process.
