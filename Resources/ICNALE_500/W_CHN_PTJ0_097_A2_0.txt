As far as I'm concerned, doing part-time jobs is not only important but necessary for college students. The reasons are as followed. First of all, most college students are not teenagers but adults, therefore, they shouldn't depend all on their parents. On the other hand, the expenses of studying in colleges are much larger than that of studying in high schools. Don't you think that we should do something to reduce the burden on our parents? Doing part-time jobs is a good way to help us. Then, considering that the experiences of real society will benefit the college students a lot when hunting for jobs, part-time jobs, and part-time jobs is important. By taking a major-related part-time job, students can not only improve their academic studied but gain much experience that they will never get from the textbooks. The students who do part-time jobs have more opportunities to meet people from all walks of life and will be faced up with a wider variety of problems to solve, which will teach the students a lot about the real society. As we all know, the life is the best teacher in our life. At last, some people say that the students may have the enough time to do study and jobs at the same time. In fact, take my experience for example; the college students have a lot of time after the study and many people kill the time by playing computer games. Why don't we spend the time doing some jobs? To conclude, I think that doing part-jobs is very important for college students. There is no doubt that the jobs will bring us many benefits in many ways.
