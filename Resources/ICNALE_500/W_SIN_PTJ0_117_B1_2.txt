Going to college ushers in a new phase of life for the teenager or young adult. For many, college is a time for exploration and adventure, and a time for learning and growth. With it, one is offered new and more varied choices. Taking up a part-time job is just one of the many options that one could choose from, and in my opinion, is not important in the life of a college student. Of course, there are many advantages of having a part time job --- for example, monetary incentives, opportunity to learn useful skills, and a simulation of the working world. However, there are many other activities that one could get involved in that offer similar benefits, and would allow one to enjoy a fulfilling college life. These include, but are not limited to, co-curricular activities, volunteering programmes, and innovative opportunities to break new ground and make change. Given that most college students will end up working for the next forty years after graduation, there is no harm in indulging in enriching, non-work activities during the college years. Unless one really requires the extra source of income, I suggest that it is not really crucial for college students to have a part-time job.
