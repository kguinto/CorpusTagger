It was said that knowledge does not exist only in your classroom. In my opinion, it is good for college students to have a part-time job because students can earn more money from it, and it gives more experience and opportunity for students' future occupation. Having more pocket money is students' dream, and a part-time job can do. Most teenagers have a problem about lack of money. Some of them want to buy something special, but they do not have enough money for it. Some use money up before the end of a week or a month. So, they do a part-time job to earn more money. Although the job gives a little amount of money, it requires such a little quality worker that students can apply. A part-time job can be a great opportunity for students' future. The students can find out what they like, what they can do, and what they are good at. They also experience some critical situations and how to do with it. When they are grown-up, their experience makes them more efficient than the other. That means they have more chance to be successful workers. Despite of tiredness and a low wage, a part-time job gives college students a lot of advantages. The students can manage their time to get more money, more experience, and more opportunity that they never get from their school.
