Personally I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. The reason behind is because college students are mature enough to earn their own pocket money for their own expenses. By earning this tiny little bit of pocket money, it is able to lessen the burden of the parents or they might get things that they like on their own without depending on their parents. Besides being able to get something that they like by themselves, they are also able to gain experience. Experience is something that is a value-added element to a fresh graduate! Academically good is a very normal phenomenal in this century, when you walk down the road 9 out of 10 are graduated from university. So what's the thing that can make you outstanding from the rest? "Experience" is the key to differentiate you from the others! With "Experience" you are able to do things more efficiently and faster compared to those who are new and they need time to pick up certain skills or knowledge about the job. Experience also help you in making important decision in your life as these tiny little experience you gather it might be able to make a very big different in your life.
