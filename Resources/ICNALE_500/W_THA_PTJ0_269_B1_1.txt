Having a part-time job is a good way to earn money. But if you have a part- time job, you must spend your leisure time by working in order to earn a lot more money. In my opinion, I think college students are not necessary to earn a lot of money. They can ask their parents if they are lack of it. But I do not mean that the college students should only depend on their father and mother, however, they have to live economically in stead of lose their time working to get money. Trying not to get a lot of bill from parents and living by the sufficiency economy are the best ways to help them save money and have plenty of time to spend by reading text book or doing school works, assignment, etc. A large number of college students, who have a part- time job, do not study well because they have to spend their time of studying to working. In comparing students who have no job to do, could study better the one who has a job and they have a lot of time to relax and study. So, I strongly disagree with the topic that 'it is importance for the college students to have a part-time job.
