 I disagree with this point. It is not really important to have a part time job. It depends on individual. Some people are financially weak and therefore they need to work to earn money as their daily allowances. Many things need money such as paying school fees, buying food all these and many others. Due to high cost of living, everything needs money. Money is one of the important factors to survive and therefore college students work to earn money. One of my friends works part time at Macdonald after school at night and during weekends as well. Some students whose family financially good and able to them therefore there isn't any necessary to work to earn money. And sometimes working as a part time worker may not be a good idea because working can take up a lot of time. With that, there will be lesser time to study and do your own things. Academic grades could drop if the working students do not manage their time wisely and effectively. Lack of sleeps will result in productive learning in class as students would be sleeping in class instead of paying attention in class. In conclusion, it is not important for college students to work.
