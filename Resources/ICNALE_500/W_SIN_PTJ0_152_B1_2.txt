College. That wonderful period of your life bridging the increased freedoms of adulthood with the energy and ignorance of teenagehood. This is the time for exploration and self-discovery with ones' newly found independence without the crippling responsibilities that adulthood entails. A part time job could very well provide such an opportunity for self-discovery and independence and should be encouraged for all. A part time job prepares one for the rigours and grind of daily working life. One of the greatest prices of adulthood is the need to do things which you do not necessarily want to do. A part time job prepares one for this, especially since the normal college life generally does not sufficiently emphasize the consequences of ones' actions. While one can skip lessons with impunity, the same could not be said for work commitments. The entry level work that part time jobs often entail also help to ensure that students remain grounded even after they begin working, never forgetting those who are less fortunate than they are. Furthermore, a part time job also allows one to take responsibility for ones' own spending. This allows students to understand the value of money better and to be able to better prepare themselves for the vicissitudes of adult life.
