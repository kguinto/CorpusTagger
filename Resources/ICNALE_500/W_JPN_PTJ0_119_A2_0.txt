I agree that college students have a part-time job. I think that a part-time job gives us many things. It is next things. First, of course, I get money by working. This is very important to college students to live alone. Second, I can experience the real work. A part-time job is a step to work in a society. If I went to a society without having a part-time job, I'll suffer stresses not to know around. If you experience some species of apart-time job, you'll not suffer. Third, I can often experience connections with workers. This is important. Job place is Life place, so I must enjoy working. I don't want to work in boring place. I don't enjoy working to get money. But I think to enjoy working with workers. In fact, I have a part-time job now. And that is the second job in life. I get job's money for a living. I work for a living, but I get many things more than that. I think study is more important than a part-time job. So, I must not have a part-time job more than need to live. A part-time job has good point more than bad. Thanks to a part-time job, I grew up. This experience is priceless.
