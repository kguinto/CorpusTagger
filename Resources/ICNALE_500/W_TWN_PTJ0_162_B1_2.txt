I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. First of all, as a college student, the knowledge from the text book is not the only resource to learn, the skills in life which beside the text book are also important, so it would be a good chance for college students to have a part time job to learn other things that could not get from normal school life. Also, a college student should also learn how to be independent in economy. That is, it is not so good for a college student who still gets money from their parents. On the other hand, if a college student can get a part-time job, he or she can buy the things he / she like without guilty. Finally, a college student can learn pre job lesson by having a part-time job. There are very different environments in college and real society, so if a college student can make the part-time job as a practice for stepping into the real society, he or she might be can get prepared much quickly than other college students who don't have a part-time job. Those are the reasons why I think that that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.
