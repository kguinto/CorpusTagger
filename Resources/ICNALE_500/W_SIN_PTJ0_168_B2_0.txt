I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Personally, I hold a part-time job as a private tutor, and having done so for the past semester, I feel that the benefits outweigh the costs. The benefits of holding a part-time job are first of all --- the obvious monetary reimbursements that allows one to fund his expenses, which brings upon the chance to practise financial planning and experience independence. In addition, if the student chooses to experiment with different part-time jobs over his course of study, he can then be exposed to different career paths, which increases his awareness of the kinds of jobs he likes and dislikes. This is especially beneficial during the student's course of study, as he would be making many important decisions, such as what to specialize or major in, and understanding where his interests and passions lie would help him in deciding more wisely. Certainly, there are costs to working part-time during college, such as the opportunity cost of time, which can be otherwise spent revising and working on assignments. One risks burning out over time if the part-time job is of a time-consuming or strenuous nature. Hence, it is also crucial that the student chooses his part-time job with discretion and much consideration.
