In my opinion of course i agree with topic a, because I think students who have a part time job while they are studying can get the best experience more than another person. Big knowledge and big experience can't get from just only a class. Part time job make you to be a professional in one day because you make it everyday. Your days will be taking to the advantage. You will know how to divide your time each day which your part time job should be does not affect to your health and student academic performance, so you can get a good job without impede academic performance and school performance of their duties. Above expectations, You might find good friends and good boss that they can help you when you are in trouble in the future. About your love maybe you might find your real love at a office. Not only will you got a experience a good friend and a good boss. You will also get money, I think it make you proud in your self. The most important you will help your father and mother about the finance within your family and your father and mother will be proud in your self. Hey everyone Let's go to working.
