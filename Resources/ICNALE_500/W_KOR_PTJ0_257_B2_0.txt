For some people, the word'part-time' makes them feel it'not consistent'. Therefore, they think doing part-time job does not have many advantages and people do not have to do it if they are not desperate. However, I believe that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. For me, my part-time jobs gave me great opportunities to experience extraordinary things that I could not think of if I did not do any part-time jobs. Let me take you some examples. First, I had a part-time job that is for student who cannot hear well. I took a course with him and I typed after the professor's voice. He understood the lecture looking at the monitor that showed what the professor said. Through this experience, I could break my prejudice on the handicapped. Also, it was very meaningful for me because I had a new friend! This example shows that part-time job provides opportunities for making friends with various people. And now, I am doing a part-time job as a librarian. This work requires responsibility and social skills. Often, imagining the situation that I do something impolite and make teachers and students upset, I feel nervous. But I think this experience is beneficial for me. After graduating the college, students should work with lots of seniors. We can face such situations through the part-time job before we move on to the'real society'. Furthermore, we are able to build capacity related to independence, both financially and affectively.
