Working during college, even in a position that is not directly related to your field of study, will give you an edge over other applicants. Significant work experience, along with good references from supervisors or co-workers, proves to potential employers that you have the basic qualities which make a good employee; dependability, responsibility, work ethic, and the ability to learn new skills. Work experience also shows that you have had some real-world, adult experiences and that you can handle yourself outside of the classroom and off campus. Beside that, having a part-time job will help you financially. It can help you pay for living expenses. Taking on financial responsibility also takes some of the load off of your parent's shoulders if they are helping you with your expenses. Your parents will not be around forever, and so you have to gradually become responsible for all of your expenses. The sooner you begin this process, the easier it becomes and the faster you will become 100% independent financially. Keeping a part-time job, helps you learn to budget and handle money. If you have specific bills that need to be paid every month, you will learn to budget so that you have enough money for them. This will make independent living less of a shock later on, when you will have multiple bills (rent, groceries, utilities, credit card, etc) to pay monthly. Having some of your own money also makes you appreciate its value. You may think twice about a purchase that you do not really need.
