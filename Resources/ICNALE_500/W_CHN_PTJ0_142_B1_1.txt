Some people are asking this question: is it important for students to have a part-time job? I agree with the idea. I have the following reasons below. After graduating from high school, students who admitted by college have many spare time so that they don't know how to make their lives colorful. Therefore, taking a part-time job is a proper way. They can do something more interesting and meet more people. Most students are isolated from society before. What they should do is study. Though this institution is not acceptable, we have no choice. So taking a part-time job is the proper way to know something about the society we are living in. Then we can learn more knowledge about the real society when we graduate. On the other hand, it is also a way to earn some pocket money we used to getting from our parents. Decreasing parents'burden is every college students should make efforts to do, since we are not earning money now. Above all, from my perspective, taking a part-time job is very important for college students; it not only can make our lives more colorful but also can know something about society.
