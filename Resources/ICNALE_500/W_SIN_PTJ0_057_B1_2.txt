I think that it is not important for college students to have a part-time job. Going through college, or university, is a time of learning and the student should be whole-heartedly focused on the acquisition of knowledge and of gaining relevant skills for the working world. However, this does not have to be achieved through students taking up part-time jobs outside of curriculum time in university. Universities offer students many opportunities such as internships, courses and workshops, directly and indirectly, for them to have a glimpse of the working world and to gain skills about how best to carry themselves in the working world. Hence, a part-time job would not be as important in this context as the students would not require a part-time job to gain experience about the working world. Some may argue that a part-time job is important for students to earn some pocket money during their university or college years so they will be less of a burden to their parents who have to help pay for their education. I believe that this is true, and that college students should try their best to help lessen the burden on their parents. However, there are ways that this can be done without compromising the student's education on a part-time job. For example, the student can earn a decent amount of money during internships. This can help to pay for their daily expenses, lessening their parents' burden, and students will also learn a great deal during the internships, more than when they are just taking up a job, as internships require students to work closely with the employers, and also allows them to create networks that would serve important in future.
