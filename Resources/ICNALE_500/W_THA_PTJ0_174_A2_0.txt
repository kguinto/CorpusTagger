I agree because working part time job takes chance for us to do extremely activity and get very nice experience. We spend our free time very benefits and we can train from work and we increase our skill because we have more responsibility in work and study. The work will take students get money from work too and we will be different than other friends because they still ask money from their parents but we can have our money by ourselves. Job that we have to do, we must appreciate with the work. We must happy to do and it must safe to do. We should tell our parents about part time so they don't worry about us. We have many choice to choose place to work such as KFC, MK restaurants, SEVENSEN ice cream shop, etc. The reasons that student choose to work should be experience rather than money. The work takes many significant but it can destroy the study result. Both of them should be perfect if you can't do it just study only. It about Thai society that people in a good grade will have a good job, so if you think you may fail the study because do part time job. Don't take that risk. Just patient to read book and try to study best.
