Job count is rare today. Maybe I graduated according to unemployment, because there were not any support. Both lack experience. If the student is currently working part time would benefit their cause very much. With work experience can earn special money and is important to use free time to benefit. Essential university students require costly. After that conflict with the students to work part time which is important. Perhaps if the graduates may be supported on any job considered extremely lucky. To work outside university gave many opportunity to see different world. Friends at workplace good and teach to work well. Become an adult and don't ask money with parents. Many things to pay in university. Papers, pens, books and etc. are expensive. Food we must eat everyday so hard to save money. Only one thing to help one self is do part time. Part time can do in university too. To help teachers or in the faculty. They also pay for students that help work in the faculty. So we don't have to run to work but can work in the place that study. It's save and don't tired. So try to do job when need to do because it help and very value.
