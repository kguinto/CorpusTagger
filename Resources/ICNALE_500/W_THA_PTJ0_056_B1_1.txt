I disagree that college student should have pan-time job. This is not the time to work or earn money, but this is the time for studying. Study is the most importance in outlives. Working part-time job is not good way to use free time well, but the simple way to use free time well is reading lessons from the class. We should read or review the lessons if we have free time. We shouldn't waste time to earn money now because finally, we will graduate from the university, so that will be our time to earn for having job. We must pay attention a lot of studying both inside the class and outside the class. I think working part-time job is wasting time. Part-time job is hard job because we haven't graduated, so we don't have knowledge enough to work comfortable job. If we do part-time job now, the job must be waitress, waiter, house keeper, or etc. These are hard jobs. Someone may think that these are not hard jobs- but low money we will get from these jobs. We should go to the library to search information about studying. If we do part-time job, we will not have time to read the book or lessons from the class, so perhaps, we will not pass the exams because we don't have enough time to read the books. On the other hand, if we pay attention for studying now, we will graduate with good grade, so we will surely get very good and comfortable jobs.
