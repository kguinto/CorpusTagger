I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Because it can learn more skills in the part-time job, like communication and persuade. And through having a part-time job, for college students can find their interests and have full lifestyle planning before graduated from college. In this day, more and more company pay attention about who have a part-time job within college. Because they want them have basic skills, like knowing company environment and what the company doing about. Like me, I have one or more part-time job during school. I can learn some skills in that place, like being boss's assistance and done work with coworkers. Having a part-time job is a good learning opportunity for college students to have a part-time job. But having a part-time job not effect we learn at school. I think having a part-time job have advantage and disadvantage. The advantage are having some basic skills from the job place you stayed and making you have specific goals in the future. The disadvantage is effect your grade in the school you learned. Sum of all, having a part-time job have many effect, either it have positive effect or have negative effect.
