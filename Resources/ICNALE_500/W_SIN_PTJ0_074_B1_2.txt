The general notion is that college students should take up a part-time job. A part-time job will help college students to gain exposure into the working environment. Not only will they gain valuable experience, they would also be able to sustain themselves with some form of allowance. Most students might be slightly clueless on what their future entails. By taking a part-time job, they gain insight and slowly discover if that line of work is indeed suited for them. Furthermore, the skillsets that are learnt from these jobs can be hardwired and useful in future applications. Moreover, rather wasting time during long vacations, a job is both productive and beneficial to the individual as well society in general. For students, which are slightly more ambitious, a part-time job can help to spruce up their portfolios and resumes. However, on the flip side, some may argue that part-time jobs are not necessary. Life is short and the vacations should be spent pursing hobbies and interests to further one's knowledge while young. Staying stuck in the same environment for a lengthened period maybe detrimental to personal development. College students should instead travel to places and see the world, pick up a new skill or even pursue personal projects. The working life can wait because you only live once. In conclusion, a good balance might be needed as all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. The converse may be true as well. It also depends on the individuals needs and wants from life as well. This questions proves to be a smaller scale of how do we achieve a good life balance? It also raises the possibility of actually mixing work and play together.
