I completely agree with the point that it is important for college students to have a part-time job because I think that it will bring us many advantages. First, there will be a chance to increase our experiences if we have a part-time job. As someone says, experience is money. Taking part-time job makes us adjust to the society in advance, and found a foundation on our future life. Second, through the part-time job, we will earn some money and help us realize how hardly and difficult when our parents raise us. Third, as the society developing, the comprehensive people will be more and more important. Communicating ability will play a more important role in our daily life. Taking part-time job may make us improve it and make many friends which are our power when we meet something. Finally, it is also a leisure time. When we study day after day, some suitable leisure time will relax our physical and mental so that to increase our efficiency in study. So because of the reasons we can say that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. If you have a chance, please try it. I believe you will never regret.
