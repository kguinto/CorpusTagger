As more and more students taking part-time job, there is concern today about the advantage and disadvantage of doing part-time job. For our college students, part-time job can partly offer our study as the tuition fees have greatly increased and our bank systems fail to loan student effectively. On the anther hand, part-time job also get them know the hardship of earning money in order to change their bad habits. In order to be confronted with the challenge that more and more companies pay attention to work experience, they will feel easier when they attend job if they have part-time job which will help them gain work experience and benefit their future job hunting. What's more, part-time job do offer us opportunities to use what we learn into practice and even go beyond what we are taught in class. For me, what we need to do is to try our best to make a perfect balance between working time and study time. College offer us the stage of study as well as part-time job offer us the stage of practice. If we take a good knowledge of that point, we will surely gain great achievement in our colorful college life.
