In my opinion, I think it's important for college students to have a part-time job. Why? Because it can not only increase our ability in solving financial problems but also broadens our knowledge in social activities. Take myself for example: I had a part-time job when I was freshmen. After school, I went to a ice cream house which owned by my aunt to help her selling ice cream. Though it was tired after the job. I enjoyed it. Not because the money but the guests I met. The most impressed thing was a little boy who came with his mother. I could hear his loudly crying far from three blocks away. Surprisingly, after his hands hold ice cream tightly from my hands. He began to smile and had happiness on his face. It was such a miracle. I was totally stocked by this dramatically scene. Looking at his tiny hands hold the ice cream, tiny tone link on the ice cream, it made me forget the tiredness of the work. I received out of my imagination before I hadn't done this job. By doing so, I know much things in the way that it can not explain in the normal sense. Just like the little boy. I met lots of people and lots of different situations. It helps me enhance the competence to handle the problems I will meet in the future. Frankly speaking, It's really important for college students to have a part-time job.
