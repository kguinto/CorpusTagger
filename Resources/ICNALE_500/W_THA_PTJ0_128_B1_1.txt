I strongly agree with that because it can help parents to save a lot of money and get good experiences for work. Money is important for education. When I need use money for education, I can use my money. Parents are proud in your child. Parents think me to grow completely and spend free time usefully. It's better than play games or shopping. However studying is more important than do a part-time job. They should spend time appropriately. They shouldn't work so hard that they can't go to university. I think college students who have a part-time job are good and diligent. I hope they will be happy in the future. When they write a job record on their CV, they will be very proud in themselves that they used to work before. The experience indicated that they spent time valuable and activate themselves for exposing to learn new things all the time. I wish students can see how interesting to have part time job and how benefits for their lives. They won't regret about that even they will be more tired but it's worth for doing it. Besides, they can prove about their patient to control themselves to work and study in the same time.
