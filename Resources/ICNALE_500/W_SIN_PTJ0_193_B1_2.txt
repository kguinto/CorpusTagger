I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Firstly, as college students, we tend to be more independent at our age and often have to use our own money to pay for our own needs, both basic and material needs. Since we are all grown-ups now, we have the abilities to work and earn money to support our own needs. As such, we will probably feel bad to ask for money from our parents and, hence it is important to depend on our own capabilities and have a part-time job that allows us to earn money and support ourselves. Secondly, It is important that we start building cash reserves because we may need this cash for several reasons, be it to pay our school fees or to plan for the future. For example, investments require capital or we may need the money on rainy days. Therefore it is always safe to have sufficient cash reserves with us. Thirdly, having a part-time job also increases our exposure to the outside world. For instance, there are always politics at work. By accumulating experience and exposure, we can better understand the different operations of certain jobs and how to handle human relations more effectively. In conclusion, it is important for college students to have a part-time job to earn cash and also gain experience. Nevertheless, it is also important that the students know how to achieve a balance between work and studies.
