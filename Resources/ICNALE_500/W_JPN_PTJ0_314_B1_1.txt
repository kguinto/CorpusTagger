I think it is very important part-time job for me. I have some reasons. First, I don't have enough money. But I want to make a trip. And I think we should not be dependent on my parents. So, doing part-time job is important to me. Second reason is that we will soon do job hunting. I think part-time job is a great experience for us. I am working at French restaurant now. I experienced what is hospitality there. For example, I study a way of talking and choice of words. I think talking skill is very important in communication or business. I have to talk with many customers. I was poor at talking but, I become good at talking gradually now. And I studied how to management. The restaurant that I am working is very small. So, I must keep accounts. I did not know bookkeeping, so I studied that and got a skill. I want to be a certified public accountant, so that experience was profitable. Because part-time job give me a skill, I think part-time job is important. For that reasons, I think it is very important for college student to have a part-time job.
