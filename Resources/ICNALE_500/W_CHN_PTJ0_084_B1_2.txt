I hold a view that it is of great significance for college students to have part-time jobs. As undergraduates, we are gaining more knowledge and techniques for a better position in the future. However, the fact isn't usually the same as what we imagine. To live up our dreams, experience is also in need as well as skills. We can benefit from part-time jobs a lot. First of all, while many of us have lost ourselves on campus, regular tasks can make us keep a balance between work and play. It helps us establish good working habits for further development. Though we might make errors, good learners view them as a constructive part of process. Besides, what we have learned can be applied to working. We can find out what the career is in real life, and decide whether we will choose it as our job or not when graduating. Strategies may be adjusted. We shall make sure which way to go. What's more, part-time jobs help practice our communicative ability. We ought to develop a good interpersonal relationship in society. Social skills we obtain through part-time jobs are vital to get along with people. It is believed that people with working experience can do their best to control anxiety during interview. In addition, the reason which seems more realistic is that, we usually lack of money. Everybody wants to be independent when he reaches adult age. We are unwilling to accept money from parents any more. Part-time jobs offer us extra gains and relieve our economic pressures. No matter what you prefer to do, lawyer, businessman, or official, social practice is necessary to you. You can't avoid contacting the society when you grow up. Part-time jobs give you opportunities to see the real world outside.
