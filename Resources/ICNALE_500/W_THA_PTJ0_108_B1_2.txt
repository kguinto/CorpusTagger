In my opinion, it is important for college students to have a part-time job while in college because it goes a long way to equip them with enough job experience while still in college, and by the time they graduate, then they stand a better chance of getting a job than other applicants with little experience. And having a part-time job will help them financially. A part-time job can help them pay for living expenses, including housing, food, books and clothes. Beside it helps them learn to budget and handle money. If they have specific bills that need to be paid every month, such as the car insurance or cell phone, they will learn to budget so that they have enough money for them and having some of their own money also makes them appreciate its value. Lastly, working part-time during college will help them spend more useful time. In conclusion, holding down a part-time job during college is important for many different reasons. They will make themselves more employable, learn some personal and financial responsibility and experience life outside the classroom. Some of the most successful college students are successful because their part-time job allowed them to learn an important element of success, time management.
