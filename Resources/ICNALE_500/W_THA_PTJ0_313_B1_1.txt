I think it's important for college students to have part-time job because they will have money for spending to buy something that they like, clothes, gifts, shoes, books, watches, computer games, etc. We always focus on children learn special. This is from the special school it is only knowledge of books. But from the work it will be knowledge of the world. (Special Education is an important thing but it is not that we must pay attention to that thing). In present it has more part-time jobs for college students to do. So, they could find a part-time job to do when they have free time. It's a better than they spend time for playing a computer games, surf the internet, or something that can make them to get track of time. When they have a part-time job they will get the most experience from them job because they will have anything to do. And they will find that they can work well when they receive money from them job. They will use their experience for working in the future or they can use experience for studying in the college. It's can be better if they spend time to working They can spend money to buy something that they want to buy or something that they like!
