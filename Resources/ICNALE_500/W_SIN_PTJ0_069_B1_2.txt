 I agree to this statement to a small extent. The main purpose of tertiary education is to provide college students with the knowledge and ability to be productive in the workforce after the completion of their studies. Therefore it is not as important to get a part time job as compared to focusing on completing the studies first. There are instances in which part time jobs are beneficial and important to college students. Those aspiring to join certain organisations would be inclined to look for job opportunities which expose them to similar job scope. For example, a college student studying accounting would be more inclined to look for an account's assistant position in order to understand the requirements of being an accountant. On the other hand, a college student's priority is to study instead of working and studying simultaneously. That has to be a clear objective for the student and he should be focused on completing his studies before stepping into the working world. Besides, college students should be involved in school activities and engaging the community instead of getting a part time job. For example, a college student could participate in overseas community involvement programmes to gain insight into a different environment from what he experience locally. Some of these experiences are what he may not be able go through if he had taken a part time job.
