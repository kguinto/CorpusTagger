From the perspective of a college student, I feel it is potentially distracting to be working in a part time job. Many college students engage themselves in a part time job to provide for their daily expenses or save up to pay for their college tuition fee. However I feel that having a job at this juncture distracts you from your main focus, which is to attain maximum absorption of the material taught in school. By working in a part time job - especially during college years - where studying is at its most intense and its truly a make or break moment for many students, I find that it saps away the energy of the students. This would result in them being less productive in classes and projects. Additionally, they would not be able to put 100% of their heart and soul into projects due to their commitments. Some may argue that having a part-time job may be beneficial for students to learn about the importance of hard work and the preciousness of money. However, I beg to differ and feel that this learning experience can easily be had during the high school years. College is a place of rich diversity, where bright minds and ideas run amok. To make students tired unnecessarily from the part time jobs would be essentially robbing the of their chance to shine in academics!
