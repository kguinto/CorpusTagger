I did not agree with college students have to do a part-time job because the main roles of them are studied hard and a little bit spent the time for their friends. However, part-time job can make money for the study but if they did not have time to review the lesson, they will do the score badly and effective in the long term about their future career. Many students have their reason of doing part-time job such as lacking of scholarship, spending a lot of money, lost for gambling, etc. but I think they should find another way to solve the problems instead of working part-time job that I will explain. First reason, lacking of scholarship, is the most problem that many people encounter. In the present, government has many scholarships for students that talented moreover students can loan the scholarships from government. Second reason, spending a lot of money, is depend on students that they can allocate their money well or bad. The last reason, lost for gambling, is very ridiculous because they have to solve the problem from the causes. In conclusion, I still confirm that part-time job did not appropriate for the students that they have to mainly study for their better things in the future.
