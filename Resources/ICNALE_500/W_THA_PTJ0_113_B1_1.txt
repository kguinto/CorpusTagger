To my mind, I think that it's moderately important for college students to have a part-time job. The reason is the students have duty to study. But if you have free times, you can work for part-time job. Personly, I don't have a lot of free times to do anything. I think that studying in university is harder and more difficult than secondary education. For me, university education and life in university is so different from the past. When I study in bachelor's degree, I must move to live in dorm that can change my life and view immediately. I must control and manage everything about my mind. I use a lot of times for adjusting myself to get used to it. I have ever thought that I should work a part-time job in order to lessen my parents works. But in the real situation, I don't have a lot of times to do a part-time job. Because, I have to do my homeworks and review my lessons in my free times. However, my some friends have financial problems. So, they have to work a part-time job for solving their problems. I think that's a good solution but, I can't. Finally, I will attend to study hard and study with my best attempt. So, I have a dream too. My dream is getting the scholarship to study abroad in master's degree. I hope that someday my dream comes true, and my parents will proud of me.
