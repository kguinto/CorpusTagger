I agree with it. Because we have no money, it is important for us to have a part-time job, too. Thanks to the money which is earning by a part-time job, our life become rich. If there is not much money which is earning by a part-time job, we can not buy things which we want. For example, there are famous shoes or comic books and so on. I also think that having a part-time job become studying society. We will be able to learn a lot of things by it. And, we will have a lot of friends by it. I think making many friends is very good. If we have a lot of friends, we get a lot of information which we don't know. In that information, there is the one such as a big news of other college or a lot of rumors. I also think that having a part-time job become great advantageous when we interviewing. By having a part-time job, we will be able to get a lot of skills. I also heard that my friend's life style was improved by it. Because we can have a lot of merits, I think having a part-time job is very good.
