I do not agree with this statement. Full-time college students should focus on their studies. If they had any extra time, they should use the time to study so that they could realise their full potential in their studies. However, students with financial difficulty should have a part-time job to help lessen the financial burden of the family provided that the student is capable enough that having a job would not have significant effect on his studies. But this is group of people is a minority of the student population. Part-time job may also be useful for putting it in his resume if it is relevant to the career that the student hopes to do in the future. Part-time jobs could also be an exposure for the student so that he could get a better picture of how the industry is like. Although experience would be beneficial for students in the future, their results in their studies would be more important as it is still the most basic requirement that employers will be looking at. In conclusion, it is not important for all full-time college students to have a part-time job but it would be beneficial for students with financial difficulty or those who already have an idea on what his future career path will be.
