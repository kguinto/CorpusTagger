I agree with a part-time job of college students. I think that a part-time job of college students leads them to independence economically and mentally. First, college students who have part-time jobs can understand how hard to get even a little money. Then they use money carefully and deliberately. And if they want to study abroad, get driver's license, or travel, I think they had better pay these cost themselves. It is not good to depend on their parents. Second, their workplace is little society. There are complex human relations to seniors or juniors, and responsibility for their jobs. Before they join "real society, they should practice in advance. In fact I have two part-time jobs. There, I can learn polite attitude and words, and how to communicate with customer. And I get many good friends. Because they have different opinions from me, these influence my view of life. I think meeting various people develops me. I'm often scolded by my seniors, but it is also good experience for me and I think that I get patience. Surely, studying is not ignored. But it is only students who can experience many jobs such as waitress. In my school life, I want to do as many as I can.
