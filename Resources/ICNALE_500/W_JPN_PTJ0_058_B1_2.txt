I think it is important to have a part-time job for college students. Of course, it isn't the most important to do that. It is because that we should go to college to study something interesting for us and that we should start having full-time job at once if we think making money is the most important. I think experiencing a part-time job is good unless our study make bad result. By having a part-time job, we can communicate with people who we can't talk with in my usual college life. That experience is useful now, not only in our future. Now, I teach some subjects in the cram school where I went in my high school days. IJ talk with my students and other teachers not only study but also anything else. They vary in age from young to elderly, so their ideas are different very much. I can get a lot of views. My senior has a part-time job at old people's home. He supports their life and talk with them. They sometimes forget who he is and repeat the same story to him. But he told me that their peculiar atmosphere and their figures thank many people sent him. We can't do such experience when we go to only college, so I think having a part-time job is important for college students.
