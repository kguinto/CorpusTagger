It depends. College students who take on part-time job need to understand their objectives of doing certain things, before actually doing it. For many students, the main reason for the need to having a part-time job is basically due to the need for money. School fees are expensive and with all the daily expenses which include transport fees, hostel fees as well as textbooks which are very expensive, it is hard not to earn some income for sustainability. However, this is only required if students have the determination and see the need to fulfil such requirements themselves, rather than relying on parents or other sources of income, if they come from rich families. Apart from the money generated from having part-time job, it could be due to the need to gain working experience to better prepare students for the working society when they graduate in the near future. Working during the semester holidays has always been the norm for many students since they usually have nothing to do at home and will decide to just venture out to earn some income. I would not see having a part-time job as being important for college students. Students without part-time job can strive well too, in their academic areas as well as non-academic commitments. However, I believe it is important for one to have a part-time job, because it allows you to manage time really efficiently. And I personally take on 8 students for private tuition separately. This has, in many ways, allowed me to gain valuable experience.
