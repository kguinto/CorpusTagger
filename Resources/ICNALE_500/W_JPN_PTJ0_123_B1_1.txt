I agree the opinion, because almost students will get a job after graduating college. When they enter a company, they experience many things that they won't have done. There is big difference between company and college. That time, if they experience part time job, they will get accustom to the company earlier than not experience. Through having a part time job, students can get much know-how in the case of business which the students can't study at their college. And we can get the chances that we make friends with people who don't have common points in their daily life. For many students who don't have a job, their social is college. They can make friends only through class or circle. But through part time job, we can make friends except college students and professor easily. Of course, the most important thing for college students is studying. It is nonsense to being crazy for the part time job too much and lazing studying. It is necessary to get balance between studying and working. But college time is important for young people. It is mottainai that students spend their time only to studying! I think young people should experience many things positively. Getting a part time job is one of the choices students can choose. Of course students can select another choice, for example circle-activity, volunteer, getting license etc Those are important and meaningful, but we can't get money through those things. A part time job is a valuable choice killing three birds with one stone for us that we can get money, experiment, and friends.
