I agree with the idea that it is important for colleague student to have a part-time job. After we graduate the university, we will have to work for company. So while we are still universal students, we had better have part-time jobs and experience many important things that we aren't able to experience only by working. And by trying a lot of kind of works, we will able to have keys for finding what kind of works we want to have after we graduate the university. Now I work for a cram school and teach students who will take entrance exams. I knew that it is difficult to explain to people even things I can understand and that it is important to see the problems in the point of view of people who don't know the ways to solve the problems. And I am able to get accustomed to talk in public and learn the manner that is necessary for us to live among human relationships. I thought it is important not only to teach subjects for entrance exams but also support with students' minds that fight against nervous feeling before the exam. While we are universal student, we think we have a lot of time but actually we can't have as enough time as we think. So we had better do things that we can't do only now. Let's play a lot, study and work a lot by having part-time jobs, to train our minds for leading meaningful life in the future.
