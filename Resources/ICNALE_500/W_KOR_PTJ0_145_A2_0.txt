A part-time job is a form of employment that carries fewer hours per week than a full-time job. I have a part-time job at the school. Because I want to use my own money earned. But I also attend the school. With both is not easy. Obviously one thing gives a negative impact on the rest. It is possible that you can not only be injured, but also get fatigue. Therefore, it's a bad influence on your own work such as health, study and normal pattern in life. Too tired and cannot concentrate in studies. And receives a lot of stress. If you can afford the time, you should go to the travel. After getting a job, maybe you don't have enough time to go to the travel. If you don't afford the money, try to borrow money from the bank just a little. When you've got a job, you can pay back easily. The most important thing is developing you and experiencing various things. Please do not part-time job and spend time wisely. But is not always a bad thing. Meet new friends, and you can try a lot of good experience. If you want to work part-time and studying both the good and you should be thinking a lot. It is very important and also the choice of job. Therefore, plan well before you start work and the schedule should be designed.
