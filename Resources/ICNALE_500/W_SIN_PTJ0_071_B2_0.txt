The question argues whether or not it is necessary for college students to hold a part-time job. I disagree that it is important for the students to be holding a part-time job. A student's main goal should be to learn and study, in other words to seek education. In other words, those actions are what make a student a student. A part-time job pushes the student out into the corporate world, where education is no longer the main aim; rather, he becomes an employee and is expected to help the company reap profits and prevent the incurring of losses. Therefore, holding a part-time job conflicts the duties of the student, whereby a student should be expected to be learning about differentiating the right from wrong and identifying the grey areas, or further knowledge for human general knowledge and capacity; while the duties of the employee is simply to concentrate on earning money or profits. Furthermore, holding a part time job does not affect how good a student is in terms of extra-curricular activities. A part time job encompasses the selfish needs of monetary gains and rewards, despite the increase in experience that may be useful for later applications for jobs. In other words, the act of holding a part time job only adds value to the person in the corporate identity, but does not add value to the identity of a student.
