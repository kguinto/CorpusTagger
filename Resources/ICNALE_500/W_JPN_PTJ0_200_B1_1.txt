I really agree with this opinion. Maybe someone says it's a waste of time for the students, but I never think so. Because I regard it not as a way of getting money but as a sight of the society. I also have a part time job, then I found some good points of it. At first, it's so important to do what we've never done. The experience gives us new ideas. And I think young people can get more and better ideas from things. The dramatic change from receiver to server might give us some big discovery. Second, in near future we'll have a work anyway, so it becomes a good practice and a useful information for choosing a job. Take me for example, when I was a small childe I wanted to become a cook of cakes, then as I became a collage student I had a part time job of cake shop assistant. So I was glad (a part of) my dream came true, but in same time I knew the work is hard so much. And I though it's just good for me to be an assistant of cook. Third, working enable us to feel the relationship with the society keenly. When I was given a pay the first time in my life, I felt as if I was admitted from the society. And I realized I would soon become an adult. As long as we don't neglect study that is our main job, we could get the thing what is more than the pay from a part time job.
