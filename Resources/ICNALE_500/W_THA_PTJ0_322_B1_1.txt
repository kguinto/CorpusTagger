I think in Thailand it's depend on each person because they don't have the same background about financial. They shouldn't decide to do part-time job by themselves but should ask their parents before they make a decision because some jobs can cheat you by paying high incomes but don't have a royalty such as break the rules or offend the laws. Moreover, they should manage time for jobs and time for study. Anyway, In Europe or USA it's important for college students to have part-time job because it's can prove that they have mature to do everything by themselves and make they have more self-confidence and ready to create their own life-style. the benefit of part-time job such as you will have more experience, you ought to solve your problems by yourself, your parents would proud of you because you can relief your parents expenses but everything may be have disadvantages such as if you can't manage your time, your grade will fall down and make your parents disappointed so if you want to do this you must think twice that it isn't too hard for you to do and don't make your parents upset.
