Yes, I agree that college students should participate in part-time jobs, mainly because part-time jobs allow students to learn practical experience, earn money, manage their time better and make more new friends. Getting involved in part time jobs, firstly, allow students to experience how the real world works. This, they may never ever learn in the college. College revolves around teaching and learning mainly theories, which can never mimic the real working league. Things such as emotional quotient (EQ) or how to handle or react to others are not what can be taught or learnt in college. However, the experience each individual gets depends on the nature of the job, administrative jobs usually allow students to acquire soft skills, while manual jobs such as waiter allow students to hone their EQ and resilience. Secondly, part-time jobs allow students to earn some quick money for their own purpose on top of their allowance. The need for additional money could be due to the cost of transport. College students are paying adult fair, even though they can choose to purchase concession passes. Furthermore, textbooks are not as cheap as those in middle or high schools. Additionally, money is required by some to satisfy their wants, and usually parents do not sponsor students their wants. Hence, the need for part-time jobs. Other reasons include management of time because students have to juggle between work and studies. Students may take the opportunity to manage their time better to strive for the best of both ends. Next, making friends from work might help students to expand their social network, and this friendship might come in handy in the future. Therefore, I agree that college students should participate in part-time jobs.
