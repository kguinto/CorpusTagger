To ascertain if it is important for college students to be employed part-time, we need to consider various factors. Also, college students in different countries have different living standards and hence difference requirements. Here, I will talk about students living in Singapore. In Singapore, most college students either live at home or on campus. Either way, the country is rather small and hence students do not need to spend too much money. As a result, they may not need to have part-time jobs to supplement themselves. Furthermore, studying in Singapore is extremely competitive and students may not be able to afford the time to work part-time while juggling studies. However, considering students of less-able economic backgrounds; yes, as college students, some may argue that their schedules are more flexible. If planned well, students can find time to take on jobs to earn money so as to contribute to their family's income. Also, with part-time jobs, students are exposed to the real world and can learn practical skills that may not be taught in college. In conclusion, to say whether it is important or not, depends on each student's circumstances. It is not possible to fit every college student into one mould.
