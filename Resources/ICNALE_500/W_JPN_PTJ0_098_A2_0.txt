I agree this statement. I think that there are four advantages. First, you can know the importance to make money by yourself. And you will appreciate to your parents. You may feel happy to work because you can use the money you make yourself. You will be big man as human being because you can learn various things. Second, more and more you raise the opportunity of communication. I think this is one of the most important of all when you go to the society after you graduated college. And you will be able to raise communication ability. You will be good at talking to someone. Third, you will be able to make friends in another college. When you don't work in the day and your college also doesn't work, you may play with your friend so to speak your college. Thanks to your friends, you enjoy living in your work time life and so on. Fourth, you can contribute to the society. If you do part-time job, the economy become more active. Conversely, I think also a disadvantage. If you do part-time job, your study time reduce. But you are only careful that situation. So I agree this statement.
