I agree that having part-time job is very important for college students. Firstly, part time job can provide financial independence to students. As the tuition and other burden are quite high, sometimes, parents of students cannot afford to support everything, which can be a big problem to students who have to study. Part-time job can provide additional money to the students, helping them concentrate on their own studies. Secondly, having part-time can be another education method for college students to learn about real life and economy. College students can be insensitive to the society where they would live on, while they study theories and schools in colleges, where are far from the real life. In that case, part-time job experiences can give a real situation to students. Students can apply what they have learned during the part-time job experiences, and acquire some meaningful lessons which cannot be taught in the class room. For example, the students in the college of education can learn some realistic teaching techniques when they are privately tutoring students. Thirdly, part-time job of college students can be beneficial for society, too. While many employers want cheap and well-educated workers, the real situation is far from their hope. Usually, many educated workers are too expensive to employ, while cheap workers are sometimes illiterate or under-educated. In that situation, college students can be the mediation of two conditions and they can serve as good alternatives. Actually, there are so many companies and government departments which employ college students as part-time-internship-workers because they are cheaper than formal employees, and they can be easily educated than cheaper workers. As a result, having part-time jobs of college students is very beneficial and educational activities both for society, colleges, and the students themselves.
