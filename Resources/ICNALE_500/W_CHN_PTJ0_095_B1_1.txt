Nowadays, there is a heated debating about whether it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Different people hold the different opinions. You cannot image how terrible it is for a college student to have a part-time job, people who object to the opinion emphasize this. From the point of their view, it is the course-studying that we college students should concentrate on and doing a part-time job wastes plenty of our time, what is worse, what it brings us in wealthy is far less than what it takes us in time and knowledge. They also assume that we will earn more in future in return once we contribute all of our time to studying during college, it's a further investment. While, when it comes to the topic, the others put the great agreement on college students to have a part-time job. They stress that no matter how rich or poor we are, we should go for a job in college, and it's not a matter of earning money, but an opportunity to close to society. What's more, it's not merely for us students to accumulate the experience, but a chance to apply what we learn in class to the reality. Taking part-time jobs will obviously do much good to student; it's not a waste of time, not to speak to the short-sighted. What is known to used all is that every coin has two sides, but as to have a part-time job, I think, we students benefit from it more than what we lose from it, and what the society really needs is　typed talent, but not the ones who can recite a great many articles, who can tell a quantity of theories, or who can just write a pile of useless papers.
