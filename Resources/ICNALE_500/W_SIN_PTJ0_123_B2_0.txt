I strongly agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. In college, the tuition fees at this stage tend to be higher relative to other stages of academic learning, amounting to thousands every academic year. Unfortunately, not all are fortunate enough to get a scholarship to fund their education so that they will not have financial worries in college. These fees could thus prove to be a burden to the students' families. Assuming two breadwinners, an average middle-income family will probably earn about $6000-$8000 monthly. One child in college will already take up a substantial amount of the family's income, potentially compromising on other necessities and welfare aspects for the family, including savings. As a college student, he would have reached a level of maturity of which he should make effort to contribute to the family instead of fully relying on his parents. Hence, working part-time to lessen the financial burden of his family would be one way to do so. On the other hand, working part-time could also be seen as an opportunity to learn time management and application of skills. His free time that could have been used for study or leisure purposes would be used to work instead but it is necessary to strike a balance among all aspects. In addition, for example in the case of a marketing student, working part-time with a marketing firm will not only allow him to apply the concepts he has learnt in college, but he will also gain work experience which can make him a more attractive candidate for a permanent job in the future.
