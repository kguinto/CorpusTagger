For the number of students who has part-time jobs is increasing, many different voices have sprang up. Some people disagree with it but others agree with it. For me, I cheer on it and I think part-time jobs are beneficial to our college students. And I have three reasons for it. First, having the part-time job is a good way to earn money. The poor college students need the money to support their families. Their parents won't be worried about the money for their children to go to universities. Second, the money can make poor students have more opportunities to do what they are interested in, for instance, they can use it to buy sport equipment like basketball to exercise. The life in college won't be too boring if you are enjoying what you like. Third, having a part-time job is a process to join the society. It is a useful experience for our college students to immigrate knowledge and practice. The more you learn about the society, the easier you can find a job after you graduate. In a whole, it is really important to have part-time jobs for all college students. So I think the colleges should promote it and encourage students to have this experience.
