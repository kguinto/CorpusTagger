I agree this statement. Because part-time job give us precious experience. And, we need money to live. For example, I work in JUKU. I experience precious time. Education is reception for me before. But, education means giving for me now. Education is very difficult. I realize this now. First, I worry that I work in JUKU. Now, I don't regret that. Making money is also important point for us. I was given money by parents before. So, making money is also giving me a few proud. Sure, I am not independent and can't live without parents. Junior high school student is difficult for me. I usually can't realize what they think. But, they give me energy. Maybe, some people think that part-time job prevented students from studying. It is right idea, sure. Some people can't concentrate in their study. But, other people can work in part-time job and can study hard. Maybe, it is minority. But we should not ignore them. Both studying hard and working hard in part-time job is difficult for young people. Little by little, we will be used to being this. If we used to being this once, we may are strong as adult than before. So, part-time job is important for us.
