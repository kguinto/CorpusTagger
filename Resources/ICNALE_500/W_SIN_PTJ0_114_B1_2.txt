I think I should have a part time job. By the way, I am a college student, so this essay is on topic. Just in case you are wondering. This is important to me because I can get money. Money is generally important to a person because with money you can buy many good things, like food, clothes, houses, can go on holidays, and most importantly can find a wife. With a part time job, you can get experience in the working life, which is always important because experience is important in finding future part time jobs. This is circular logic. And therefore it is illogical. I realise that I just made a grammatical error there as I started a sentence with the word and. "And" cannot be used to start a sentence unless the sentence starts like this one, where and is not used in its usual sense. The correct use of the word "and" is used this way, in that part time job and jobs are both types of work. That is a correct use of the word. When I grow up, I want to get a part time job as a English tutor so that I can teach young kids grammar such as whatever I wrote above. I hope this essay is humourous and that you laugh.
