I believe that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. There are many benefits to having one. It not only acts as a source for extra pocket money but also helps students to better manage time. In addition, the student will be exposed to many new experiences that can only be achieved by working that particular job. For example, the student could get a job as a customer service officer and learn how to effectively deal with angry customers or discover their passion for this occupation. The latter would be extremely useful for college students who are unclear about their future career. Moreover, a part-time job would be useful for college students as they build up networks or forge new friendships. For instance, working in an events job, where most of them consists of mainly students, allows for one to know more people from different backgrounds or schools. However, a college student should also take note not to over-work and neglect their studies as being a student should be considered their full time job. Lastly, if college students feel that they are easily stress and are definitely not able to commit to both studies and working at the same time are better off without a part-time job as well.
