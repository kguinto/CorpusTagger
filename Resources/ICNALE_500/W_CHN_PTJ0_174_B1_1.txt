Nowadays more and more college students are crazy about taking part-time jobs. I believe that a part-time job has both advantages and disadvantages, and it is important for the students to have an appropriate balance between study and work. Some people believe that taking a part-time job certainly brings about several advantages. First, students who do a part-time job can earn themselves sums of money which helps to release the financial burden on their family. Second, it gives the students a chance to know the society to learn to be independent. In addition, they can also get financial reward and working experience as well, such as teaching or selling practice, which is helpful to their growth. What's more, they can put what they have learned into practice so that they can improve their studies and personalities, which are beneficial in their later lives. However, problems may also arise. Firstly, some students spend too much time doing part-time jobs while pay little attention on their studies. Secondly, when taking part-time jobs, the students may be distracted from their studies by the colorful lives in the society. Thirdly, some students may be cheated or hurt by their employers when they enter into the society, because they don't know how to protect themselves. In my opinion, taking part-time jobs provides students with more chances of social practice, which benefits them both psychologically and economically so long as they keep a balance between study and jobs.
