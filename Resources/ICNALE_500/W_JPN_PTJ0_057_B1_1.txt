I disagree with the idea that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. It is true that you make money which you use freely, but having a part-time job leads to the fact that you do not have less free time. You shoud not waste precious time. You should study abroad, travel in Japan. Time and so on to broden your mind, see things from various angles, and understand different cultures. Time is money. And why do you go to a university ?You go there to earn a few allowance?The answer is no. Yout parents work hard and save a lot of money for you. They would like you to study different things deeply and be a person who work for Japan help sick people and so on. You must not lead a life for yourself but for other people. In addition, it is said that having a part time job enables you to study society. Is it true?You can not understand what working is all about from a part-time work. So, I think that it is not important for college student to have a part-time job. You should make much effort to improve yourself and discovery your potentiality. You need provide for the future.
