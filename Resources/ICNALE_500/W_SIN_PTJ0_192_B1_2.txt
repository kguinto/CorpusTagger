Throughout the various educational institutes, teachers generally encourage students to acquire knowledge not only by the means of a textbook, but also to gain new experiences that will help them to grow as a person. The idea of learning out of the classroom is especially important as what defines us as a person is not only what we know but also what are our values and beliefs. The primary role of a student is to study and to acquire knowledge. However, in pragmatic Singapore, the traditional view of an excellent student is that of someone who excels in academia with other areas being secondary. As such, students are expected to devote all their free time to studying for exams and not engage in other activities that may rob their time from studying. By working part-time, one will be exposed to the working society where everything is uncertain, unlike the certainty of textbooks used in colleges or universities. Such situations are good learning experiences as they present problems where the answers to it are not found in textbooks. Having nothing to rely on, one will be forced to talk to their peers and superiors to find a solution to the problem. Through such interactions, one learns much more from the lives and way of thinking from others. While I believe in the merits of obtaining knowledge through textbooks, I believe that learning through experiences is much more valuable as the experience is solely that person's and will be unique to him. The experience gained will go a long way in shaping the person's character and beliefs and ultimately the choices that he makes in life. Therefore, taking up part-time jobs as a college student is beneficial and important although not at the expense of skipping classes.
