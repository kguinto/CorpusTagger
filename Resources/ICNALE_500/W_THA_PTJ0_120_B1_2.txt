I think part-time job is not important for college student because we need to use a lot of time with book and try to make good grade and when you study with work it may have effect to your health, it make you can't ready to receive knowledge in class and strain as a result of can't sleep enough. But if you have problem about money or you have free time apart from read a book or do homework and housework you can apply for part-time job because you will get wages and experience that it might be necessary in future. You will have good skill to solve the immediate problems. You will have better personality and can make good relationship with another people. When you get your wages that come from your labor, you will proud of yourself and appreciate the value of money. Moreover you will be responsible and more circumspect. If you choose the job associated with subjects that you learn, it will be useful in the future. It a good idea to have part-time job if you can manage your time but important thing of college students is study and spend your college life to make a good thing.
