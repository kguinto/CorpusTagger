Agree or disagree? I would agree that part-time jobs are encouraged for college students but definitely not something that is compulsory. Part-time jobs are a way that college students can be exposed to the outside working work when they are still in their studying years. Contrasting to their studying life, the working environment demands more flexibility and critical thinking from the students that made them better students. Part-time jobs help to develop students to be more resilient and independent individuals. College students are usually most attracted to the salary of the part-time jobs at their age and this allows them to understand the reality of moneymaking. Reality always have a way in making people grow and this is not an exception to college students as they learn how to treasure and cherish what is already given to them and be more motivated to study harder, paving their way to a brighter future. Part-time jobs also allow students to be exposed to different work fields and to be equipped with different skill sets that not only plays in "beautifying effect" in their portfolio or resume but also able to create students who have a holistic approach in their character development and learning attitudes. These experiences are very valuable to students as they may not have the chance to engage in such opportunities to learn and do such activities when they enter the work force. In conclusion, the main focus of a college student should be on studying. If this focus is being affected by the involvement in part-time jobs, then the part-time job should be discontinued for that individual.
