In the present, Some college student do a Part-time job. But should the college students do a Part -time job? They have many opinions about the Part-time job. Some are agree but some people didn't. The opinion that agree to do a Part-time job is because student can earn money by themselves and get the special skill, For example if college students be a salesman they can get the communication skills. Furthermore Part-time job can teach they how to spend the money and how to work with other people. Another reason that college student should have part time jobs is because they can gain more knowledge of what they are learning in school by working. The opinion that disagree is they think that the Part-time job make the college student lose time for study and do a homework. They think that part time jobs can reduce concentration from studying and put more stress on the student. For conclusion, I think that part time jobs for college student are a good idea because it teaches them skills, it gives them experience, it teaches them how to be responsible, and you can make friends by doing the job. Other people may think that part time jobs take off time from studying, puts more stress on them during undergraduated, or distract them from their homework or schoolwork, but I think that they could either do part time jobs in the summer, they could do them occasionally, or they could do their homework faster.
