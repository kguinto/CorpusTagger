I do emphasize that it needs all college students if you have a time. It has many merits which know in the future. Now you are grown up and help you get many experiences which can help you choose the best occupation. It can be piled up one by one from now on. This is very important for me because I have no any experience now. Graduate the high school when I was a final grade of high school student. At that time, I have enough time to what I want to do. So I decide to get the part time job. I worked in a very little office in the building. That's the first time of part time job. It was very useful because I met lots of people who were older than me. They taught me lots of skill what they know when I met difficult thing. And tell me about him or her selves. I think it was helpful to me but that was very easy. At there, there was a man who responsible to us from first to the end. He was very kind and versatile man. So I got many but I helped a lot that I don't have an opportunity to stand myself and solve the thing by myself. So in this summer vacation, I will try to get much hard job than before. So I think it can be very useful and helpful for my experience.
