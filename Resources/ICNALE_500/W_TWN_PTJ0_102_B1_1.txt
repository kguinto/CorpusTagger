I don't agree this essay. I have three reasons to support my answer. First, maybe people think that you should have experience to get along with other people before you graduate from university. Because they are not students anymore, they can't get used to their new environment. There are no teachers and classmates, and no one can forgive you easily if you make mistakes. But my answer is different from others, I think you can join campus organizations to get along with other people rather than you have a part-time job. Learning in campus organizations is the best choice for university students, and you don't waste much time to do things which you don't like. Second, university students have a part-time job that they usually couldn't concentrate on their schoolwork, so it means that they sacrifice their schoolwork because of few money. Do important things first. You'd better spend your time on some worthwhile things, and don't threw yourself into a confusion. Do the right thing at the right time. Third, I think that may influence other students because of one proverb which we have been heard: monkeys see; monkeys do. So university students a have part-time job that maybe not a good thing for themselves.
