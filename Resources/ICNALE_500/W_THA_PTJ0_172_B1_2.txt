In my opinion, Part time job is a one of a part job that has in every country. Even if a smaller village. Part time job has a many types for example education, economic, and businesses especially entertain way. Part time job is a very important of people in present. Because part time job is a take a shorter time more full time job and some job also get earn more full time job. I think part time job is a popular more full time job because everybody can work part time job that no have effect with lifestyle. And teenagers can work part time job too. Otherwise part time job have a many time that you can choose by yourself so you will work part time job in you free time. But part time job also have a bad way too. Because part time job use time shorter more full time job so a person who work part time job will gain a salary less than full time job. And most of job that worked by part time job it not stable more full time job. However, students need to consider by themselves if part time job is important for them to do while they are studying. Not do it just because it is a fashion or want to spend money on unnecessary things. Don't forget that you are a student and what should be your duty. No one knows only yourself so please keep considering about that.
