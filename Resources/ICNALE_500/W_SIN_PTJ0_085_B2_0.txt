It is common for many college students to have a part-time job such as a tuition teacher during the course of their tertiary studies. Amidst the rigorous academic and social demands of college, many people have wondered whether it is necessary and important for students to have a part-time job. This is because many feel that a part-time job only adds unnecessary stress for students and reduces students' time for studying, participating in school activities and socialising, all of which are widely considered as important aspects of college life. However, I still feel that it is important for college students to have a part-time job due to various reasons. Firstly, a part-time job can provide additional financial support for students. College fees are expensive despite subsidy from the Ministry of Education, with more than $10, 000 needed for four years of study. Additionally, college expenditure is expensive, with a typical textbook costing at least $30. Participation fees are required for most activities in college also such as clubs and competitions. Secondly, a part-time job can help in the personal development of students. A part-time job can help students develop their character by learning how to take responsibility and manage their time properly. This is because students will need to manage their time properly in order to balance their college life and part- time job. In addition, students will need to take responsibility for any mistakes made during the part-time job and not quit only after a short period of work. In conclusion, a part-time job is important as it provides financial support for students and helps in their personal development. This is reflected in the observation that many students, despite their part-time job, are indeed able to manage their college life and part-time job properly.
