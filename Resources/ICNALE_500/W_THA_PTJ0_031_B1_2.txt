I agree to have part time job. Collage student will be ready for real work after they graduate. But! Think about what purpose now? Studying right? The word part time job is doing a job in some part of your time. It means you do a part time job when you have free time. I think if any of us have free time we should do a part time job. We will learn a lot of that. For example, we know how to work with other people, we know how to deal with difficult situations and people, we know how to make friends in work place not only in the university. Actually, friends in workplace and university are different a lot. Friends in university are fun, we can talk everything, we help to do homework and help before test. Friends in workplace are friendly but don't talk too much. They will work and work without talking but when we found problem we will help each other. Friends in workplace will teach you how to work and how to react to things you don't like. Money is also good reason for do part time job. Some friends work in a food shop and they got tip from customers. They are very happy and they can buy whatever. So I think up to you. Part time is good, I agree to have but should not a main choice.
