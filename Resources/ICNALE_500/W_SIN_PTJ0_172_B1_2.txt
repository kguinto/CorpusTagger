I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job because it provides them with the relevant working experience they would need when they start working in the future. College students would be able to gain working experience and skills which are things that school is unable to teach them. Also, with the lack of experience, students are more likely to engage to part-time job which start from lower levels. I feel that it is essential to start from the lower levels as this allows students to understand what are some of the problems faced as the lower levels when these students move up higher levels in the future. Part-time job allows students to interact with more people of different background and ages, the people that these students usually interact with are probably their family members and their friends. By taking up a part-time job, they get to interact with the supervisor, co-workers as well as customers who probably come from all works of life. Personally, after college, I took up several part time jobs and I interacted with people of different ages and backgrounds. What I learnt was that everyone has a story to share and it is always interesting to learn something new because these people are able to provide you with an additional opinion which you may need when making decisions in the future. Part-time jobs allow students to step out of their comfort zone because there is really much to learn out there. In this modern day and age, many students are definitely more privileged than students in the past and hence they may not be able to be as empathetic. Thus, it is important for college students to have a part-time job because there is much to learn.
