Since some people need to focus on doing something such as full time students, housewives, they need money to sustain their living at the same time. They do not have enough time for them to work as a full-time worker. The best way to solve this problem is to do some part time job. Since working hour of part time jobs is more flexible and shorter in general, those people can earn money when they have time. Using full time university students as an example, many of them need lot of money not just the tuition fee but the gathering fee in order to keep up with their friends, however, students need to attend the classes. It is hard for them to find a full time job which fits their time-table, but having a part time job would fulfill what they want, they can earn money but do not conflict their study time. so part time job are beneficial to people, even though it would be a good choice for long time prospect, since employees of part time job usually do not have any welfare and people will not get higher salaries even doing for a long period already.
