All across the nation, you will find many students getting part-time job during heir long school holidays, regardless of age. It is a common sight to see many students at the front of service line; in fast-food restaurants, book store or even as part-time teachers! Many engage in part-time jobs to "make end meets". allowing them to earn some pocket-money to indulge in the more extravagant sides of life. However, for a college students, it is important for them to get a part-time job not only to gain experience in life but also to prepare for their out-of-school life in the coming months. Taking up a part-time job is no longer child's play, for their own personal satisfaction. The purpose of schooling is to equip the younger generations with the necessary skills before they join the workforce. College students are at the end of their studying journey and should be thoroughly prepared once they step into the workforce, and to do so, it would be important for them to get a part-time job to learn things outside of the textbook. By getting a part-time job, they get a more in-depth understanding of the nature of the job and not just the theories they learn in classes. Many young graduates hop from industries to industries due to the lack of concrete knowledge and experience in the field. Hence, it would be useful if college students engage in part-time jobs which they presumed they were interested in, to minimise the time they take to find the right job.
