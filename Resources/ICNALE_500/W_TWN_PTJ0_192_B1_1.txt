To some extent, I would agree that part time job for student is good. The issue of student doing paid work is a complex and a sensitive one. It is difficult to say who has right to judge whether student working is "wrong" or "valuable". Even after receiving a few scholarships, loans, etc. student still needed to come up with the cash to pay for housing, phone bills, and so on. So some students spend a lot of time doing some part time jobs. For example, I got a part-time job in my school's office as well. I've learn a lot that different from school. Then, I feel pleasure because I get those fantastic experiences! The working process was definitely not easy, but it was also a happy memory! For student, doing part time job can make them learn some experiences they can't learn from school, and the difficulty of earning money. However, wasting too much times doing part time job shouldn't be courged, it is putting the cart before the horse. The main spirit of being student still learn some knowledge in school, or you don't have to be student and pay some money to do that. Whether doing part job or not, students, especially in college, should play a great role in life!!
