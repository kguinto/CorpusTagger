I think it is important for college students to have part time job. Of course, for college students, to study hard is very important, but I think there is another important things. First, this is because we can learn how hard it is to earn money. When we go shopping with friends, we usually find what we want. If we bought it with money our parents gave us, we couldn't know the value of it. By buying with money we earned, we can learn the importance of money. Second, we can contact with many types of people. In this world, a lot of people are living. But we can't meet most of them. Having a part time job gives us more opportunities to contact with people who are unknown for us, for example, employers, part time workers and consumers. Then, we can develop the skill to communicate with other people. Third, we can help our family. Until high school students, our parents had given us some money for buying something having meal or somewhere. But if we come to do these things by using the money we earned, this reduces the burden of our parents. And not only we but also they can buy what they want and eat more delicious meal. So I agree with this opinion.
