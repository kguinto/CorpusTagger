It is important for college students have a part-time job, not only for the money, but also the experience. Many students step into college without a good sense of controlling of time; they do not know how to use their time in a proper way. However, having a part-time job can give them opportunity to enjoy their college life. Being in the charge of other people, students can control themselves to obey the rules, so that they can have a good sense of time. They can know that not everywhere is just like school, not everywhere is so free. Meanwhile, during the time doing part-time jobs, students can study some more things that they cannot study in class, as well as they can take what have study in class in practice. These all cannot be studied only in school; only in society can students learn these. Besides, doing part-time jobs can offer the opportunity that students can broaden their horizon, which can be a kind of advantage in communicating with different people in different occasions. Many students in school are too shy to express themselves, which can be changed if they have a part-time job. Because when they do the part-time job, they will meet different people, they can adopt themselves to different people's opinion and attitudes. In this way, they will be more out-minded. In a word, doing part-jobs can make students enjoy their college life. If they use time in a proper way, they can make progress both in study and experience.
