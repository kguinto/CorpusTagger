I disagree with this opinion. I think it unimportant to have a part-time job for college students (but, I don't think that it is perfectly unimportant). The reason I think so is that their job is doing something they can only do when they are in college, so I think that. For example, math, they can have rarely the time to study it when they are working. And not only some subjects but also the sport club actively is important for them. Because it may be so hard but they can do their best when they have too high obstacles. But some disagree with my opinion and think it important to have a part-time job for them for leaning society or something reasons. But I think that society can be learned when they are doing a sport club or cultural club and so on. And the most reason is that they have to study or get good grade and be a person who distribute for society such as a good engineer or translator or economist and so on. So I think that it is difficult to perfectly do both of part-time job and getting good grade for them. So which is some reasons that I think that it is unimportant to have a part-time job for them.
