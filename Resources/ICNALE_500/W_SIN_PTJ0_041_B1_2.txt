In this day and age, the situation in Singapore calls for a high level of dedication to studies for students. Especially in the case of higher level academic pursuits, students will have little or not extra time to even give themselves a break from schoolwork, much less a part-time job. Hence in this aspect, I find that college student will be unlikely to juggle a part-time job in Singapore. However, circumstances may call for the need and importance for a part-time job. For instance, family financial situation may require students to head out to earn some part-time income for the family. For such students, it is imperative to work part-time for the extra income, which his/her family may depend on. Another circumstance is the case of on-the-job learning. This is an important issue because Singapore should head on to focus on hands-on learning instead of classroom learning. Many argue that the student will learn more actually doing things himself then to be force-fed with information and more information. Such work-learning are termed as internships. For this reason, I also believe that college students could head out to the workforce early. Therefore, it depends on the circumstances if college students should or should not get a part-time job.
