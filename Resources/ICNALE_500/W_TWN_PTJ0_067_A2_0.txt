I think part-time job is a important part for a college student. College students usually have little money because they have no full job. Their money is given by their parents. It cause that when they want to spend more money to do something, they have no money to do. That, some students will spend part-time to earn money. For example, my roommate, John, is a part-timer. He goes to "Welcome" Why to be a part-timer. Why should John do part-time job? His family given him little money to life because they are very poor, it cause John that go to search a good part-time job to keep his life. He earns some money, and he uses most money to rent a room. He usually goes to work at six o'clock pm and back home at two o'clock am every day. In his part-time job, he learned a lot, such as to move box, clean the shop, etc. He says that he likes his part-time job; if he had same choose to choice, he will choose the same answer--- to have a part-time job in his summer vacation. I think part-time job is an important thing for a college student even he or she do not need more money.
