I strongly agree this topic. University registration fee is very expensive. It is a burden to college student's parents. So we need a time to part-time job. University registration fee will continue to increase. Because half of University registration fee, even we have demonstration. In my think, not only college students also people who money need need to make money. Even, Because University registration fee is high there are people who give up college. A lot of talented people who need University registration fee, but because so many people to give it to God to work part-time college students to know there's a problem but there's a problem in University registration fee continues to climb looks Romagna. Must all through high school is compulsory until the student's status, but college is a selection of the selection, as well as a reason to give up college for money, not so macho that it is unfortunate. Part-time jobs for University registration fee and a boon to parents Might Be a little, but not a last resort, as well as a scholarship to study Because many students who do not, but eventually the universal part-time college students were an important tool. If the idea is a lot of universities around the restaurant, convenience store, bar restaurant where you can hire a daehaksaengman have thought that it were.
