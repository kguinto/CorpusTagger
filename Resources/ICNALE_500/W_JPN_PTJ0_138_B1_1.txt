I agree with the statement that it is important for college students to have a part-time job. Firstly, this is because we can get a lot of information to work. Some people may say that college students have less time to study. But I think that it is a very good opportunity as the preparation for going into workforce. Secondly, it is also true that money is necessary for our play. We need not only to study but also to play. It connects with making the interpersonal relationship known. Thirdly, to work, we find that it is very difficult to earn money. So we thank for our parents working hard so far for having brought us up. Fourthly, we get the opportunities to talk with people of various ages in a place of work. We can amplify knowledge by talking with various people. And we can take various advices from them. Finally, I think we can learn language to visitors properly, too. In those days, young people cannot use polite words to seniors. We can learn how to contact seniors. This is why I agree with the statement. And I think that we cannot become a sensible adult if I do not experience them.
